  Export API definition from API Center to Copilot Studio as a connector

introduction: |
  You can export an API definition from your Azure API center as a [connector in Microsoft Copilot Studio](/connectors/overview). The exported connector is available for use in Microsoft Copilot Studio, where it can be used by citizen developers to extend the capabilities of AI agents. [Learn more about extending agent capabilities with Copilot connectors](/microsoft-copilot-studio/copilot-connectors-in-copilot-studio).

  In this article, you create a custom connector from an OpenAPI definition associated with an API in an API center. Learn more about [creating a custom connector](/connectors/custom-connectors/define-openapi-definition) from an OpenAPI definition.
prerequisites:
  summary: |
    The following are prerequisites for this procedure.

  dependencies:
    - An API center instance. You can [create one](set-up-api-center.md) in the Azure portal.
