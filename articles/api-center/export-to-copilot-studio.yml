  "Export API from API Center to Copilot Studio as a connector"

introduction: |
  You can export an API from your Azure API center to a connector in Microsoft Copilot Studio. This allows you to share the API with citizen developers who can use it in their applications. The exported connector is available for use in Microsoft Copilot Studio, where it can be used to create applications and workflows.

  In this article, you create a custom connector using an OpenAPI definition in OpenAPI 2.0 format. Learn more about [creating a custom connector](/connectors/custom-connectors/define-openapi-definition) from an OpenAPI definition in the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/define-openapi-connector).
