# Track API resource dependencies in your API center 

This article explains how to track dependencies between API resources in your [Azure API center](overview.md). Tracking dependencies helps you understand how APIs, API versions, API definitions, and API deployments relate to each other and can inform decisions about API design, versioning, and governance.


Tracking dependencies is especially useful in large API programs where multiple teams manage different APIs and versions. By understanding dependencies, you can avoid breaking changes, ensure compatibility, and maintain a healthy API ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

* An [Azure API center](overview.md) resource in your Azure subscription.
* Register one or more APIs in your API center. For instructions, see [Register APIs in your API inventory](register-apis.md).
