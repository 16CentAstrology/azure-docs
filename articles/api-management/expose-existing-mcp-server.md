# Expose and govern an existing MCP server

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-standard-basic-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-standard-basic-premiumv2-standardv2-basicv2.md)]

This article shows how to use API Management to expose and govern an existing MCP-compatible server - a tool server hosted outside of API Management. Expose the server's tools through API Management using its built-in [AI gateway](genai-gateway-capabilities.md) capabilities so that MCP clients can call them using the MCP protocol. 

[!INCLUDE [preview-callout-mcp-servers](includes/preview/preview-callout-mcp-servers.md)]

Example scenarios include:

- Proxy [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) or [LangServe](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve/) tool servers through API Management with per-server authentication and rate limits.
- Securely expose Azure Logic Appsâ€“based tools to copilots using IP filtering and OAuth.
- Centralize MCP server tools from Azure Functions and open-source runtimes into [Azure API Center](../api-center/register-discover-mcp-server.md).
- Enable GitHub Copilot, Claude by Anthropic, or ChatGPT to interact securely with tools across your enterprise.

API Management also supports MCP servers natively exposed in API Management from managed REST APIs. For more information, see [Expose a REST API as an MCP server](export-rest-mcp-server.md).

## Prerequisites

+ If you don't already have an API Management instance, complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md). 
    + The following service tiers are supported for preview: classic Basic, Standard, Premium, Basic v2, Standard v2, or Premium v2.
    + In the classic Basic, Standard, or Premium tier, you must join the **AI Gateway Early** [update group](configure-service-update-settings.md) to access MCP server features. Allow up to 2 hours for the update to be applied.

+ Access to an external MCP-compatible server (for example, hosted in Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, LangServe, or other platforms).

+ Appropriate credentials to the MCP server (OAuth 2.0 client credentials or API keys) for secure access.

+ To test the MCP server, you can use Visual Studio Code with access to [GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup).

## Expose an existing MCP server

Follow these steps to expose an existing MCP server is API Management:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance.
    [!INCLUDE [preview-callout-mcp-feature-flag](includes/preview/preview-callout-mcp-feature-flag.md)]

1. In the left-hand menu, under **APIs**,select **MCP servers** > **+ Create MCP server**.
1. Select **Connect existing MCP server**.
1. In **Backend API**:
    1. Enter the existing **MCP server base URL**.
    1. Select a **Transport type**:
         - **Streamable HTTP** (default) - Server delivers data continuously over HTTP as it becomes available
         - **Server-sent events (SSE)** - Server pushes real-time updates to clients. When selected, optionally enter the following paths:
             - `/sse` - path for streaming responses
             - `/messages` - path for receiving tool requests from agents
1. In **New MCP server**:
    1. Enter a **Name** and optional **Description** for the MCP server in API Management.
    1. In **Base path**, enter a route prefix for tools. 
    1. In **Base URL**, configure the final URL where the MCP server will be accessible in API Management.
1. Select **Create**.

The MCP server is connected and is listed in the **MCP servers** pane. The **URL** column shows the MCP server URL that you can call for testing or within a client application.

> [!NOTE]
> API Management doesn't display tools from the existing MCP server. All tool registration and configuration must be done on the existing remote MCP server.
