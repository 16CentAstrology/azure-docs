# 'Quickstart: Use Terraform to configure an Azure App Service Environment v3'

App Service Environment is a single-tenant deployment of Azure App Service. You use it with an Azure virtual network. You need one subnet for a deployment of App Service Environment, and this subnet can't be used for anything else. In this quickstart, you use [Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform) to create a resource group, virtual network, and a subnet to configure an Azure App Service Environment v3. This code creates a resource group, a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution; a virtual network; and a subnet to provide network isolation and segmentation for the App Service Environment.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure resource group with a unique name.
> * Establish a virtual network with a specified name and address.
> * Generate a random name for the subnet, and create a subnet in the virtual network.
> * Delegate the subnet to the Microsoft.Web/hostingEnvironments service.
> * Generate a random name for the App Service Environment v3, and create an App Service Environment v3 in the subnet.
> * Set the internal load-balancing mode for the App Service Environment v3.
> * Set cluster settings for the App Service Environment v3.
> * Tag the App Service Environment v3.
> * Output the names of the resource group, virtual network, subnet, and App Service Environment v3.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. You can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- [Install and configure Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure).

## Implement the Terraform code

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code for this article is located in the [Azure Terraform GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-app-service-environment). You can view the log file containing the [test results from current and previous versions of Terraform](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-app-service-environment/TestRecord.md).

> See more [articles and sample code showing how to use Terraform to manage Azure resources](/azure/terraform).

1. Create a directory in which to test and run the sample Terraform code, and make it the current directory.

1. Create a file named `main.tf`, and insert the following code:
    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-app-service-environment/main.tf":::

1. Create a file named `outputs.tf`, and insert the following code:
    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-app-service-environment/outputs.tf":::

1. Create a file named `providers.tf`, and insert the following code:
    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-app-service-environment/providers.tf":::

1. Create a file named `variables.tf`, and insert the following code:
    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-app-service-environment/variables.tf":::

## Initialize Terraform

[!INCLUDE [terraform-init.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-init.md)]

## Create a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan.md)]

## Apply a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-apply-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-apply-plan.md)]

## Verify the results

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Get the Azure resource group name.

    ```console
    resource_group_name=$(terraform output -raw resource_group_name)
    ```

1. Get the virtual network name.

    ```console
    virtual_network_name=$(terraform output -raw virtual_network_name)
    ```

1. Get the subnet name.

    ```console
    subnet_name=$(terraform output -raw subnet_name)
    ```

1. Run `az appservice ase show` to view the App Service Environment v3.

    ```azurecli
    az appservice ase show --name $app_service_environment_v3_name --resource-group $resource_group_name  
    ```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Get the Azure resource group name.

    ```console
    $resource_group_name=$(terraform output -raw resource_group_name)
    ```

1. Get the virtual network name.

    ```console
    $virtual_network_name=$(terraform output -virtual_network_name)
    ```

1. Get the subnet name.

    ```console
    $subnet_name=$(terraform output -subnet_name)
    ```

1. Run `Get-AzAppServiceEnvironment` to view the AKS cluster within the Azure Extended Zone.

    ```azurepowershell
    Get-AzAppServiceEnvironment -Name $app_service_environment_v3_name -ResourceGroupName $resource_group_name 
    ```
