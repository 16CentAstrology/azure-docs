# Quickstart: Create a scheduled WebJob

> [!NOTE]
> WebJobs for **Windows container**, **Linux code**, and **Linux container** is in preview. WebJobs for Windows code is generally available.
WebJobs on [Azure App Service](index.yml) enable you automate repetitive tasks on your web app. WebJobs can be continuous, triggered manually, or scheduled. All [App Service Plans]() support WebJobs and there's no extra cost to use WebJobs. Azure Functions provides another way to run programs and scripts. For a comparison between WebJobs and Functions, see [Choose between Flow, Logic Apps, Functions, and WebJobs](../azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs.md).

In this quickstart, you create a scheduled WebJob to delete temporary files from a specified directory.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio).
- An App Service App on Linux. In this quickstart, [a Python app](quickstart-python.md) is used.
- **[Always on](configure-common.md?tabs=portal)** must enabled on your app.
