> Azure Cache for Redis announced its retirement timeline on Sep 29, 2025. If you have existing Azure Cache for Redis resources, you can continue using them until the service is fully retired on Sep 29. 2028. We recommend moving your existing Azure Cache for Redis instances to [Azure Managed Redis](/azure/redis/).
