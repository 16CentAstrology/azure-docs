# Durable execution using the Durable Task Scheduler (preview)

Durable Task Scheduler expands on Durable Functions experiences and capabilities, providing a managed backend that introduces a fault-tolerant approach to running code. 

With the Durable Task Scheduler managed backend, you can author orchestrations as code using the [Durable Functions framework](#using-durable-functions-in-azure-functions) or [Durable Task SDKs](#using-the-durable-task-sdk-in-other-azure-services). By eliminating the need to manage your own backend storage, Durable Task Scheduler makes tasks such as maintaining and purging orchestration data no longer the responsibility of development teams. 

## Features 

Durable Task Scheduler:

- Handles applications that require high throughput for scheduling orchestrations and their associated activities. 
- Manages retries and interruptions through automatic retries and state persistence.
- Provides an easy debugging experience for stuck orchestrations via [the Durable Task Scheduler dashboard]()
- The ability to deploy new versions of orchestration code while existing orchestrations were in flight

### Performance

- **Performance**

   The Durable Task Scheduler  [Learn more about Durable Task Scheduler performance.](./docs/performance.md)

### Authentication

The Durable Task Scheduler also adheres to Azureâ€™s best practices for security by enabling developers to manage authorization and access through Managed Identity. This allows for the assignment of granular permissions, ensuring that team members can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

### Debugging

The Durable Task Scheduler includes an [orchestration debugging and management dashboard](./docs/dashboard.md), making it extremely easy for developers to track the progress and state of the orchestrations, as well as insights into the inputs and outputs of each activity.

## Durable Task Scheduler in Azure Compute Services

Author your orchestrations as code using Durable Functions or Durable Task SDKs. Connect your workloads to the Durable Task Scheduler, which:
- Handles orchestrations and task scheduling
- Persists orchestration state
- Manages orchestration and task failures
- Load balances orchestration execution at scale

These capabilities significantly reduce operational overhead, allowing you to focus on delivering business value. The choice of developer orchestration framework depends on where your applications are hosted. You can use:
- [Durable Functions in Azure Functions](#using-durable-functions-in-azure-functions)
- [The Durable Task SDK in Azure Container Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service, App Service, etc.](#using-the-durable-task-sdk-in-other-azure-services)

### Using Durable Functions in Azure Functions

[Durable Functions](../durable-functions-overview.md) is an extension of Azure Functions that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless compute environment. With Durable Functions, you define:
- Stateful operations (durable executions) by writing orchestrations 
- Stateful entities using the Azure Functions programming model 

Durable Functions works with all Azure Functions programming languages and supports [multiple application patterns](../durable-functions-overview.md#application-patterns).

Durable Functions uses a backend component, which refers to the storage provider that is used to:
- Schedule orchestrations and tasks
- Persist the state of orchestrations and entities. 

Durable Functions supports four storage providers:

- [Azure Storage](../durable-functions-storage-providers.md#azure-storage)
- [Netherite](../durable-functions-storage-providers.md#netherite)
- [Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)](../durable-functions-storage-providers.md#microsoft-sql-server-mssql)
- [Durable Task Scheduler](../durable-functions-storage-providers.md#durable-task-scheduler)

###  Using the Durable Task SDK in other Azure Services 

In addition to Azure Functions, the Durable Task Scheduler introduces a managed workflow engine and storage provider that can be leveraged from other Azure services, such as:
- Azure Container Apps (ACA)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure App Service

You can write your orchestrations as code using the Durable Task SDKs and connect your workloads directly to the Durable Task Scheduler for scheduling and persistence of orchestration state. 

The Durable Task SDKs are available in multiple programming languages:

- [.NET](https://github.com/microsoft/durabletask-dotnet)
- [Python](https://github.com/microsoft/durabletask-python)
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/microsoft/durabletask-js)
- [Java](https://github.com/microsoft/durabletask-java)
