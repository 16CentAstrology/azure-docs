# Migrate AWS Lambda to Azure Functions

> [!NOTE]
> **Content developer**: Introduce the topic in a way that is meaningful for your service.

Migrating a serverless workload that uses AWS Lambda to Azure requires careful planning and execution. This article series provides essential guidance to help you:

- Perform a discovery process on your existing workload
- Learn how to perform key migration activities
- Evaluate and optimize a migrated workload

| :::image type="icon" source="../../migration/images/goal.svg"::: You'll build a step-by-step process for your migration that's based on the pre-migration design area reviews, discovery activities, building migration assets, and addressing downtime decisions. The process will be refined through testing and validation. |

## Scope

> [!NOTE]
> **Content developer**: Clearly set the scope and set the scope to the capabilities of the service and its dependencies. Some services have some fairly niche edges, and this migration guide should focus on the "normal" usage scope. 
>
> Consider dependencies as a component that this service needs to rely on, without which it won't fundamentally function. For example, networking aspects are a dependency (regardless of the workload objectives). On the other hand, a database typically isn't considered a dependency, if it's deployed to store workload data. Be clear about what's in scope and out of scope.

This migration series specifically addresses an AWS Lambda instance being replatformed to run in Azure Functions hosted as Flex Consumption plan, Premium plan, Dedicated plan, or Consumption plan.

These articles do not address:

- Migration to own container hosting solution, such as through Container Apps
- Hosting AWS Lambda containers in Azure
- Fundimental Azure adoption approach by your organization, such as [Azure landing zones](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) or other topics addressed in the Cloud Adoption Framework [Migrate methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/).

### Comparable functionality

This guide provides recommendations for comparable functionality. Any recommendations beyond AWS Lambda's capabilities are noted as future optimizations on Azure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While you may choose to include optimizations as part of your migration, Microsoft recommends a two-step process: migrate "like-to-like" first, and then evaluate optimization opportunities to bring out the best on Azure. 
>
> Those optimization efforts should be continuous and executed through your workload team's change control processes. A migration that adds additional capabilities during a migration incurs added risk and extends the process beyond necessary.

### Workload perspective

A migration process from AWS to Azure usually involves more than just one service in isolation, as workloads are made of many resources and processes to manage those resources. You must combine the concepts, how-tos, and examples presented in this article series along with your larger plan that involves the other components and processes in your workload to have a comprehensive strategy. 

This guide will focus only on replatforming to Azure Functions and common dependencies for serverless workloads.

## Perform pre-migration planning

Before initiating any migration, conduct a thorough evaluation of your current AWS Lambda deployment and design your end state. This step involves assessing multiple design areas of your existing implementation, identifying direct mapping opportunities, and uncovering potential challenges. 

There's no recommended order of these design areas, however we've discovered that customers that start with core serverless capabilities establish a good foundation for this process.

Perform a pre-migration evaluation of the following design areas:

- [Core serverless capabilities](./capabilities.md)
- [Identity and access management](./identity-access-management.md)
- [Deployment](./deployment.md)
- [Monitoring](./monitoring.md)
- [Dependencies](./dependencies.md)
- [Governance](./governance.md)

Each design area provides baseline comparisons, deviations, and challenges. These should not be considered the final evaluation for your use case. During the process, you're expected to complete your evaluation by reviewing the configuration and expectations of your AWS Lambda service. Those exercises are noted with &#9997;.

### Functional and non-functional objectives and targets

With the design areas in place, collect baseline information about the current run state of the system around performance, reliablity, and cost; along with any targets for those numbers. Your migration should assume those targets as measurement of business objectves and you shouldn't compromise on them. Collect the following information about your AWS Lambda deployment:

- [Budget and cost of ownership](./function-placeholder.md)
- [Reliability objectives and current reliability status](./function-placeholder.md)
- [Performance targets and current performance](./function-placeholder.md)

### Build the migration assets

There's a transition development phase where you'll need to build source code, infrastructure as code (IaC) templates, and deployment pipelines to represent the workload in Azure. These activities need to happen before you can perform the migration.

Follow the guidance in [Build migration assets](./build-migration-assets.md).

## Develop a step-by-step process for Day-0 migration

Migrations are often sequenced with a failover and failback strategy, throughly tested in pre-production environment. Learn how Microsoft recommends you prepare and perform a cutover from AWS Lambda to Azure Functions.

Follow the how-to in [Perform Day-0 migration activities to transition from AWS Lambda to Azure Functions](./perform-migration.md).

## Evaluate end-state

Before you can fully decommission the resources in AWS, you need to have full confidence that the platform is meeting current workload expectations and there are no blockers to maintainging the workload or blockers to further development on the workload.

Ensure your Azure Function is meeting expcations, [Evaluate end-state](./post-migration-checklist.md).

## Explore sample migration scenarios

These examples are based on key learnings from Azure customers who have completed this migration. They illustrate application of recommendations described in pre-migration evaluation, the process, and the end state.  It also provides suggestions on how the scenario could be further optimized on Azure.

- [Migrate an event-driven data processing pipeline](./function-placeholder.md)
- [Migrate a microservices workload](./function-placeholder.md)

## Further optimize on Azure

After you've migrated your Lambda to Azure Functions and your AWS resources are decommissioned, we recommend you explore additional features on Azure. These features can help you in future workload requirements or help close gaps in areas where your AWS Lambda solution was not meeting requirements.
