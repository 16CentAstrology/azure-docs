# Evaluate your end-state

| :::image type="icon" source="../../migration/images/goal.svg"::: You're confident that Azure Functions is performing as you planned,  completing is functional and non-functional requirements, and you feel safe to decomission your migrated AWS Lambda functionality. |
| :-- |

You have reached the point in your migration where Azure Functions is operating in production, fullfilling like-for-like functionality your workload needed out of its serverless platform. Your [Day-0 migration manual](./perform-migration.md) should include steps to validate that you've acomplished your goals and establish new baselines for key measurements in your workload. You use these findings to identify any unexpected regressions and prioritize future investements.

At this stage, your Azure Functions should be operating in production, similar to how AWS Lambda worked to fulfill the serverless requirements of the workload. Your [Day-0 migration manual](./perform-migration.md) had validation steps to reach your migration goals with a quality bar that's acceptable for your business. It's natural to establish new baselines for key measurements in your workload. Use these findings to identify any unexpected regressions and prioritize future investments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While this article talks about evaluating the workload in production, it's recommended you use this checklist as an assessment throughout and not just after your production migration.

## Post-migration evaluation checklist

> [!NOTE]

> **Content developer**: Generate a list of about 20 items that the workload team should evaluate about the success of the migration. These should map back to the pre-migration design areas, should address meeting user expectations, and cover setting new baselines. The following checklist is just an example, in addition to generic items that you'd see on many services. Include items that are highly unique to your service.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Your AWS Lambda instances are dormant, not processing any residual traffic or jobs.
> - There was no, or only an acceptiable amount of state lost, in the migration.
> - Your clients are completely configured to use the new endpoints.
> - Your serverless compute is scaling aligned to your pre-migration planning specification.
> - Your DR strategy for Azure Functions shows evidence of being ready to execute in Azure.
> - Your infrastrcuture as code and function code deployment pipelines appear to be operating.
> - You feel confident that Azure Functions will not impeed you in reaching all of the SLOs that are currently expected of your workload.

### Workload checklist

Azure Functions was likely just part of a larger workload that was migrated. In addition to validating Azure Function-specific capabilities, cover the following items at the workload level.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Your workload passes all automated and manual tests for functionality.
> - There was no, or only an acceptiable amount of state lost, in the migration.
> - Your safe deployment practices appear to be operating.
> - You're confident that your routine SDLC process can resume, and future business requirements can be implemented.
> - Your customer support team has equivilent access to the systems and data they need to perform their roles.
> - Your software engineers have equivilent access to the systems and data they need to perform their roles.
> - Your SRE team has equivilent access, alerting, observability, and health checks as before.
> - Your business intelligence systems are updated to use data generated by the new system.

## Post-migration measurement

Start capturing new baselines for new serverless compute platform.


> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Establish a new cost baseline.
>
>   It's assumed that you have the cost of running AWS Lambda (and its dependencies) as part of your pre-migration activity. Also you estimated the equivalent in Azure Functions. Now, use Azure rates to establish your new baseline. If the new baseline is higher than planned or expected, start the optimization phase to stay within budget. If it's lower, evaluate how to invest the savings.
>
> - Establish a performance baseline.
>
>   You're familar with how AWS Lambda performed over time in the ways of HTTP throughput, queueing, scaling (out and in), queue processing, and more. It's time to start building that same foundational knowledge for Azure Functions.
>
> - Establish a reliability baseline.
>
>  Start tracking key reliability metrics such as function hosting availability along with operational metrics such as MTTD, MTTR, and MTBF.


## Next step

With confidence that your workload can proceed with it's normal lifecycle concerns, budget allocation, and customer satastification, now is a good time to evaluate what additional features and funtionality Azure Functions and the larger Azure offerings can be used for in your workload.
