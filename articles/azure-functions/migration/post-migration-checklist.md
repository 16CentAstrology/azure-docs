# Evaluate your end-state

You have reached the point in your migration where Azure Functions is operating in production, fullfilling like-for-like functionality your workload needed out of its serverless platform. Your [Day-0 migration manual](./perform-migration.md) should include steps to validate that you've acomplished your goals and establish new baselines for key measurements in your workload. You use these findings to identify any unexpected regressions and prioritize future investements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While this article talks about evaluating production, it's recommended you evaluate throughout the process. Your runbook can be evaluated and your pre-production migration tests can be evaluated. You're encouraged to use this checklist as an assessment throughout this process, not just after your production migration.

## Post-migration evaluation checklist

> [!NOTE]
> **Content developer**: Generate a list of about 20 items that the workload team should evaluate about the success of the migration. These should map back to the pre-migration design areas, should address meeting user expectations, and cover setting new baselines. The following checklist is just an example, in addition to generic items that you'd see on many services, please this checklist include highly unique items to your service.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Your AWS Lambda instances are dormant, not processing any residual traffic or jobs.
> - There was no, or only an acceptiable amount of state lost, in the migration.
> - Your clients are completely configured to use the new endpoints.
> - Your serverless compute is scaling aligned to your pre-migration planning specification.
> - Your DR strategy for Azure Functions shows evidence of being ready to execute in Azure.
> - Your infrastrcuture as code and function code deployment pipelines appear to be operating.
> - You feel confident that Azure Functions will not impeed you in reaching all of the SLOs that are currently expected of your workload.

### Workload checklist

Azure functions was likely just part of a larger workload that was migrated, in addition to validating Azure Function specific capabilities, also be sure to cover the following items at the workload level.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Your workload passes all automated and manual tests for functionality.
> - There was no, or only an acceptiable amount of state lost, in the migration.
> - Your safe deployment practices appear to be operating.
> - You're confident that your routine SDLC process can resume, and future business requirements can be implemented.
> - Your customer support team has equivilent access to the systems and data they need to perform their roles.
> - Your software engineers have equivilent access to the systems and data they need to perform their roles.
> - Your SRE team has equivilent access, alerting, observability, and health checks as before.
> - Your business intelligence systems are updated to use data generated by the new system.

## Post-migration activities

In addition to verification of meeting expectations align with the work you did in the pre-migration planning, it's important to start caputring new baselines for new serverless compute platform.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Establish a new cost baseline.
>
>   You knew your run-rate in AWS Lambda for the compute and all dependencies of that, and you've estimated the equivilent run-rate of this in Azure Functions and its dependencies. Now it's time to establish the Azure rates as your new baseline. If your run-rate is higher than you planned, you can consider furuther optimizations to obtain allocated budget for your serverless compute infrastructure. If your run-rate is lower, you can evaluate how to invest those savings.
>
> - Establish a new serverless compute performance baseline.
>
>   You're familar with how AWS Lambda performed over time in the ways of HTTP throughput, queueing, scaling (out and in), queue processing, and more. It's time to start building that same foundational knowledge for Azure Functions.
>
> - Establish a new serverless compute reliability baseline.
>
>   You'll want to start tracking key reliability metrics such as function hosting  availability along with operational metrics such as MTTD, MTTR, and MTBF.

## Next step

With confidence that your workload can proceed with it's normal lifecycle concerns, budget allocation, and customer satastification, now is a good time to evaluate what additional features and funtionality Azure Functions and the larger Azure offerings can be used for in your workload.
