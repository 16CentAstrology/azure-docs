# Restore individual files with single-file restore from backups

To restore individual files no longer available in an online snapshot [single-file snapshot restore](snapshots-restore-file-single.md), you can rely on your Azure NetApp Files backup to restore individual files. With single-file restore from backup, you can restore a single file to a specific location in a volume or multiple files (up to 8) to a specific directory in the volume.

## Considerations

* If no destination path is provided during the restore operation (in which case you still need to enter a slash (/) in the Destination path), the file is restored in the original file location. If the file already exists at that location, it's overwritten by the restore operation. 
    * If the file being restored has a multi-level directory depth (for example, `/dir1/dir2/file.txt`), all of the parent directories must be present in the active file system for the restore operation to succeed. The restore operation can't create new directories. 
* If the destination path provided is invalid (non-existent in the Active file system), the operation will fail.
* A maximum of eight files can be restored to a volume in a single operation. You must wait for a restore operation to complete before initiating another operation to restore more files to that volume.
* The file list field has a character limit of 1,024 characters. 
* The target volume for the restore operation must have enough logical free space available to accommodate all the files being restored.
* The restore operation doesn't work if a directory or a soft link path is entered in the file list field.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Only _regular_ volumes can be restored single-file restore from backups. This feature is not supported with [large volumes](large-volumes-requirements-considerations.md). 

## Register the feature

Before using single file backup restore for the first time, you need to register the feature first.

1. Register the feature: 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSingleFileBackupRestore
    ```

2. Check the status of the feature registration: 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to `Registered`. Wait until the status is **Registered** before continuing.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSingleFileBackupRestore
    ```

You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status. 

## Steps

1. Under the **Backups** menu, select the backup you want to use to restore files.
1. Select the three dots `...` associated with the backup you want to use, then select **Restore Files**.

1. In the **File paths** field, enter the file names with the complete file path for each file, for example `/dir/file1.txt`. Multiple files can be entered as a comma-separated list or with line breaks between entries.

    The menu includes three optional fields:
    * **NetApp account**: This field specifies the NetApp account to which the destination volume belongs. If no value is specified, the files will be restored to the original volume.

    * **Destination volume**: This field specifies the volume to which the files will be restored. If no value is specified, the files will be restored to the original volume.

    * **Destination path**: The field specifies the directory to which the files will be restored. The destination path must already exist in the destination volume.  This field cannot be left blank. Enter a slash ( / ) to restore files to their original path locations.

1. Select **Restore** to complete the operation.
