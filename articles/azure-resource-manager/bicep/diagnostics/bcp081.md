# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP081

This diagnostic is raised when a resource or module is declared without a required version or type context that Bicep expects, or when a property value is missing or invalid in a way that violates Bicep's type checking rules.

## Description

Resource type \<resource-type@api-version> doesn't have types available. Bicep is unable to validate resource properties prior to deployment, but this won't block the resource from being deployed.

## Level

Warning

## Solutions

Fix the typo.

## Examples

The following example raises the diagnostic because the resource type is `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`, not `storageAccount` (singular).

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccount@2025-01-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageacct'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```

You can fix the diagnostic by fixing the typo:

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-01-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageacct'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```
