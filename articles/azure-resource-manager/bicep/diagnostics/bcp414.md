# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP414

This diagnostic occurs when the [reverse index operator (^)](../operators-access.md#reverse-index-accessor) is used on an expression of an unsupported type, such as object, bool, or int.

## Description

The `^` indexing operator cannot be used on base expressions of type `<data-type>`.

## Level

Error

## Examples

The following code attempts to use the `^` operator on an object, which triggers BCP414.

```bicep
var config = {
  name: 'example'
  value: 42
}

output result any = config[^1] // Error: BCP414 - The "^" indexing operator cannot be used on base expressions of type "object".
```

To access properties of an object, use the `.` operator instead of `^`. The following code corrects the previous example.

```bicep
var config = {
  name: 'example'
  value: 42
}

output result string = config.name
```
