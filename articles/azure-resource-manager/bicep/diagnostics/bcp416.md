# Bicep diagnostic code - BCP416

This diagnostic occurs when the [reverse index operator (^)](../operators-access.md#reverse-index-accessor) is used on an expression of an unsupported type, such as object, bool, or int.

## Description

The supplied string does not match the expected pattern of /<expected-pattern>.

## Level

Error

## Examples

The following code raised the diagnostic code because the resource name is not valid according to Azure rules. For more information, see [Resource name rules](../../management/resource-name-rules.md#microsoftstorage).

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource accounts 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-01-01' = {
  name: 'storage-account'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```

You can fix the issue by correcting the resource name:

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource accounts 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-01-01' = {
  name: 'storageaccount'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
```
