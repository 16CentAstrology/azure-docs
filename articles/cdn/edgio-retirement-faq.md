# Azure CDN from Edgio retirement FAQ

Azure CDN from Edgio will be retired on November 4, 2025. You must migrate your workload to Azure Front Door before this date to avoid service disruption. This article provides answers to common questions about the retirement of Azure CDN from Edgio.

## Frequently asked questions

### I see Edgio filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Can Microsoft guarantee that Azure CDN from Edgioâ€™s availability and services until November 4, 2025?

Edgio informed us that their services remain operational until at least November 4, 2025. However, we can't guarantee that Edgio doesn't unexpectedly cease operations before this date due to circumstances beyond our control.

### How does Microsoft assist me with migrating my workloads from Azure CDN from Edgio?

You're encouraged to migrate their workloads to Azure Front Door. You need to determine if Azure Front Door is suitable for their workloads and set up a test environment to validate compatibility. For a feature comparison, see [Azure Front Door and Azure CDN features](../frontdoor/front-door-cdn-comparison.md).

If Azure Front Door isn't compatible with your workload, we offer a service called [Routing Preference Unmetered](../virtual-network/ip-services/routing-preference-unmetered.md) also known as *CDN Interconnect*. This service routes traffic from your Azure resources to another CDN. You can choose to continue working with Edgio directly to minimize interruptions and keep your origins on Azure. For further information, you can contact Microsoft support or reach out to [Edgio](https://edg.io/contact-us/).
