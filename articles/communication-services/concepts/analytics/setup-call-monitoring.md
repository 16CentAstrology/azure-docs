# Setting up ACS Call Monitoring and Alerting


## Overview

This guide will help ACS Calling customers set up monitoring and alerting for their calls. Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth and effective setup process.

## Prerequisite: Enable Call Logging and Diagnostics

Before configuring monitoring, ensure that call logging and diagnostics are enabled for your Direct Routing setup. This process involves configuring Azure Communication Services (ACS) to collect call data. Detailed instructions can be found here: [Azure Communication Services-Enable Azure Monitor - An Azure Communication Services concept document | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/analytics/enable-logging).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Access the Monitoring Dashboard

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Communication Service Resource group.
2.  On the navigation blade, click on **Monitoring** and then click on **Logs**.
3.  In the query editor, enter a Kusto Query Language (KQL) for what you would like to monitor. The sample query below checks for call failure rates aggregated per hour and filters the results to only show where the failure rate exceeds 10%: 
<pre>ACSCallSummary 
| summarize UnsuccessfulCalls = countif(ParticipantEndReason != 0), TotalCalls = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h) 
| extend FailureRate = (UnsuccessfulCalls * 100.0) / TotalCalls 
| where FailureRate > 10</pre>

### Configure Alerts

1.  On the navigation blade, click on **Monitoring** and then click on **Alerts**.
2.  Click on the **Create alert rule** button.
3.  For **Signal name**, select **Custom log search**.
4.  For **Search query**, provide the query you ran in Step 1 above.
5.  Provide measurement criteria, e.g.:
    *   Measure: FailureRate
    *   Aggregation Type: Total
    *   Aggregation granularity: 1 hour
