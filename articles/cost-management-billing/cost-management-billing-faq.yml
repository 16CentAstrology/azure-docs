        answer: |
          In the Azure portal, navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** > **Cost Management** > **Cost analysis**.

          In the Azure portal, navigate to **Cost Management + Billing** > **Cost Management** > **Cost analysis**. Select **Group by** for your tag.

      - question: How do I export cost management data as a partner if I don't have an Azure subscription in my tenant?
        answer: |
          See the [Export cost data with an Azure storage account SAS key](costs/export-cost-data-storage-account-sas-key.md) article.
      - question: As a CSP partner, is Cost Management supported on Classic CSP offer in Azure Plan?
        answer: |
          Given the plans to transition customers on Classic CSP to Azure Plan on the [New Commerce experience](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/news/new-azure-experience-in-csp), Cost Management + Billing is available only for the direct partners and indirect providers of customers who are on Azure Plan. 
      - question: As a CSP partner, how can I enable the cost visibility policy at the subscription scope for my end customers and resellers on the Azure Plan?
        answer: |
          See [Enable Cost Management for Customer Tenant Subscriptions](costs/get-started-partners.md#enable-cost-management-for-customer-tenant-subscriptions) to enable the cost visibility policy for Azure consumed services at retail rates for Azure RBAC users of the subscription. As a direct partner or an indirect provider, you can view the costs in the customer tenant if you're a [billing administrator](/partner-center/account-settings/permissions-overview#billing-admin-role).
      - question: How can I charge back costs?
        answer: |
          You can allocate costs in Cost Management to see the costs that you distribute to subscriptions, resource groups, or tags in cost analysis. For more information, see the [Create and manage Azure cost allocation rules](costs/allocate-costs.md) article.
      - question: Can I use Power BI to view costs?
        answer: |
          Yes, you use [Power BI Desktop to connect to Cost Management data](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-connect-azure-cost-management) or you can use the [Cost Management Power BI App for EAs](costs/analyze-cost-data-azure-cost-management-power-bi-template-app.md).
      - question: What are the supported offer types in Cost Management?
        answer: |
          See [Supported Microsoft Azure offers](./costs/understand-cost-mgt-data.md#supported-microsoft-azure-offers).
      - question: How soon can I see my cost and usage data in Cost Management?
        answer: |
          See [Cost and usage data updates and retention](./costs/understand-cost-mgt-data.md#cost-and-usage-data-updates-and-retention).
      - question: Can I find all my cost related information in Cost Management?
        answer: |
          See [Costs included in Cost Management](costs/understand-cost-mgt-data.md#costs-included-in-cost-management).
      - question: Are allocated costs factored into budgets and forecast views?
        answer: |
          <a name="budgets-forecast"></a>Yes. Allocated costs are factored into and supported by budgets and forecasts. Budget and forecast views show costs allocated to them, as configured by cost allocation rules.
      - question: If a cost allocation rule is deleted, what happens?
        answer: |
          <a name="delete-rule"></a>When a cost allocation rule is deleted, all open and current billing month costs being allocated to the targets are removed. If the cost allocation rule existed for several months, the historical previous months of allocation data remain as originally set by the allocation rule.
      - question: Why is an enrollment admin or a billing account admin needed to create cost allocation rules?
        answer: |
          <a name="why-admin"></a>Cost allocation rules are created at either the enrollment scope (Enterprise Agreement) or the Billing account scope (Microsoft Customer Agreement). Permissions to make changes at these scopes requires billing administrator privileges.
      - question: What can happen if cost allocation rules (sources/targets) overlap?
        answer: |
          <a name="rule-overlap"></a>Rules that have either overlapping sources or overlapping targets aren't recommended. Cost Allocation rules apply in order by their creation date, so if any cost allocation rules overlap the allocation rule with the earliest creation date takes precedence.
      - question: Can I view New Commerce license and consumption products besides Azure in Cost Management?
        answer: |
          Yes. Partners with an MCA agreement can buy New Commerce license and consumption products in the Partner Center. The products are invoiced along with your Azure products and you can view the charges in Cost Management. The "Provider" dimension helps to distinguish between Azure and license-based products like Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365.

  - name: Cost Management + Billing API questions
    questions:
      - question: Where can I find API documentation for Cost Management?
        answer: |
          See the [Cost Management REST API documentation](/rest/api/cost-management/).
      - question: How do I migrate from the Enterprise Agreement APIs to the Microsoft Customer Agreement APIs?
        answer: |
          See [Migrate from Enterprise Agreement to Microsoft Customer Agreement APIs](costs/migrate-cost-management-api.md).

  - name: Cost and usage details questions
    questions:
      - question: How can I get my cost and usage details data?
        answer: |
          You can get your cost and usage details data in two main ways:
          - Use [Exports](costs/ingest-azure-usage-at-scale.md) to automatically generate and store large, recurring usage datasets in Azure Storage for analysis at scale.
          - Use the [Cost Details API](automate/get-small-usage-datasets-on-demand.md) to programmatically retrieve smaller, on-demand usage datasets.

          Choose Exports for large or recurring datasets, and the API for smaller, on-demand queries.
      - question: Where can I find information about the fields in the usage details file?
        answer: |
          For a detailed explanation of each field in the cost and usage details file, see [Understand cost details fields](automate/understand-usage-details-fields.md). This documentation provides definitions and guidance for interpreting the columns in your exported cost and usage data.
      - question: Why do I get Usage Details API timeouts?
        answer: |
           Usage Details API timeouts often occur when requesting large datasets, as the API may not be able to process and deliver the data before timing out. To avoid these issues, we recommend using [Exports](costs/ingest-azure-usage-at-scale.md) for large or recurring usage datasets, or the [Cost Details API](automate/get-small-usage-datasets-on-demand.md) for smaller, on-demand queries. For guidance on migrating from the Usage Details API, see [Migrate from the Consumption Usage Details API](automate/migrate-consumption-usage-details-api.md).cv
      - question: How do I see my recurring charges?
        answer: |
          Recurring charges are available in the cost and usage details data when viewing Actual Cost.
      - question: Where can I see tax information in Cost details?
        answer: |
          Cost details data is all pretax. Tax related charges are only available on your invoice.
      - question: Why is PAYGPrice zero for some of the records in my cost details file?
        answer: |
          If you’re an EA or MCA customer, `PAYGPrice` is populated only for first party Azure usage charges where `PricingModel` is `OnDemand`. `PAYGprice` isn't populated when `PricingModel = Reservations`, `Spot`, `Marketplace`, or `SavingsPlan`.
      - question: Does Cost and usage details data have Reservation charges?
        answer: |
          Yes it does. You can see those charges according to when the actual charges occurred (Actual Cost) or you can see the charges spread across the resources that consumed the Reservation (Amortized Cost). For more information, see [Get amortized costs](costs/manage-automation.md#get-amortized-cost-details).
      - question: Am I charged for using Cost Details API or Exports?
        answer: |
          The Cost Details API is free. Make sure to abide by the rate-limiting policies, however. For more information, see [Data latency and rate limits](costs/manage-automation.md#data-latency-and-rate-limits). The Exports feature is free to use, but you pay for the storage account that you use to store the exported data.
