# Account Administrator tasks in the Azure portal

This article explains how to perform the following tasks in the Azure portal:
- Manage your subscription's payment methods
- Remove your subscription's spending limit
- Add credits to your Azure in Open subscription

You must be the Account Administrator to perform any of these tasks.

## Edit your subscription's payment methods

> [!NOTE]
> The Reserve Bank of India has new regulations for storing credit card information that may impact credit card users in India. For more information, see [Reserve Bank of India](../understand/pay-bill.md#reserve-bank-of-india).

1. Sign in to the Azure portal as the Account Administrator.

1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing,** in the top search bar.

1. Inside of **Products + services**, select "All billing subscriptions" or "Azure Subscriptions".  Then select the subscription from the list that you'd like to replace the credit card to.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't see some of your subscriptions here, it might be because you changed the subscription directory at some point. For these subscriptions, you need to switch the directory to the original directory (the directory in which you initially signed up). Then, repeat step 2. Also, if you have multiple billing scopes, make sure you select the right one that contains the subscription you want to update.
   
1. Select the billing profile name associated to your subscription

   > [!NOTE]

1. Select **Delete** from inside of the ellipse (...) drop down next to the credit card that you'd like to remove. A Delete a payment method form appears on the right side of the window.

### Edit invoice payment address

To edit the address of your invoice payment method, select **Invoice** in the list of payment methods for your subscription. The address form opens on the right side of the window.

## Remove spending limit

The spending limit in Azure prevents spending over your credit amount. You can remove the spending limit at any time as long as there's a valid payment method associated with your Azure subscription. If you have a subscription type like Visual Studio Enterprise or Visual Studio Professional, which provides credit over several months, you can reactivate the spending limit at the start of your upcoming billing cycle.

The spending limit isnâ€™t available for subscriptions with commitment plans or with pay-as-you-go pricing.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal as the Account Administrator.
1. Search for **Cost Management + Billing**.
