# CycleCloud version 8.7.2 

## New features 

*   The Cyclecloud Slurm cluster type now supports Slurm version 24.05.6 and 24.11.3 
*   The Jetpack converge process now supports strace. 
*   The azslurm cli now includes a topology configuration generator for topology-aware slurm scheduling. 
*   The .NET runtime is no longer required by CycleServer and is no longer bundled.    

## Resolved issues 

*   The username wasn't set correctly from v1 Entra ID tokens. 
*   Nodes were sometimes displayed as converged prematurely in the UI.  
*   Editing credentials failed when using a Service Principal with a secret. 
*   Entra ID validation failed to time out correctly during network errors.
*   Sending email through CycleServer required STARTTLS.
*   Cyclecloud CLI failed Entra authentication for Service Principal with Certificate.
*   Jetpack sometimes failed to include the cluster-init script that failed in the  Stack trace displayed in the error message in the Node Details and Issues UI. 
*   Updating a user's password with the `execute` command sometimes failed on the first attempt.
*   CycleCloud incorrectly threw a "NullPointerException" when an invalid password was provided to the REST API with Entra ID authentication enabled. 
*   Removed potentially confusing Jetpack warning: `"PIDFile= references a path below legacy directory /var/run/"`. 
*   The Ubuntu `needrestart` utility would unnecessarily restart CycleCloud when other packages were updated or installed.
*   Some GPU SKUs did not automatically enable "Accelerated Networking", even though the feature is now supported. 
*   Removed references to the unused cganglia cookbook from all cluster types. 
*   The Locker identity drop down didn't handle multiple subscriptions properly. 
*   The Locker Identity field was case-sensitive, which led to failures when a cluster used the same identity as a UserAssignedIdentity, since case isn't consistently preserved.  
*   Entra users with no permissions were unable to log out. 
*   Data table initial column sizes were sometimes too small for their content. 
*   Resolved [NVD - CVE-2025-24813](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24813) 
    

## Known issues 

*   The (retired) BeeGFS cluster type requires custom images, as the Azure HPC and OpenLogic CentOS 7 images have reached end-of-life and are no longer available in the Azure Marketplace. 
*   HPC Pack Broker nodes fails to converge breaking SOA workloads and this failure will be resolved in the next release. 
*   The Altair GridEngine demo release is no longer supported. Altair GridEngine users must [upload their licensed GridEngine installer binary](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cyclecloud/gridengine.md#copy-the-binaries-into-the-cloud-locker) to their CycleCloud Storage Locker.
