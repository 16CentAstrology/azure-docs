> The Azure Data Box 80TB device will be retired on May 31, 2025. After this date, new orders for this device will no longer be accepted. However, we will continue to process and support all existing orders. The Azure Data Box service will transition to using the Next-Gen Azure Data Box 120, Azure Data Box 525, and Azure Data Box Disk devices for all offline data transfer needs.
