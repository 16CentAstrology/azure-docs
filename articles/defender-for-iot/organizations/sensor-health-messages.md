# Sensor health message reference

This article lists the sensor health messages displayed in the **Sites and sensors** page in the Azure portal.

For more information, see [Understand sensor health](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#understand-sensor-health).

## Critical messages

|Title  |Message  |Description  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Disconnected**     |   This sensor isn't communicating with Azure     |      Sensor is disconnected   |   Try signing into the sensor to check for errors or networking failures. <br><br> We also recommend reviewing the sensor networking configuration and verifying the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure.      |
|**Sanity failed**     |    This sensor failed an internal consistency check     |      Sensor fails sanity   |       The sensor is in a degraded state. <br><br> Check the sensor for hardware failures and try restarting the sensor.  If the issue isn't resolved, open a support ticket.  |
|**No traffic detected**     |   No traffic detected on the monitored network interfaces      |   No traffic detected      |  Check that the monitoring ports are connected to SPAN/monitor ports on the adjacent switch and that traffic is active on the link. At least one link with network traffic should be connected to the monitor ports.       |

## Warning messages

|Title  |Message  |Description  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Failed to send update** |There was an error uploading the file to the sensor |Upload error |Verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with download.microsoft.com and retry. <br><br> If the problem persists,  open a support ticket.|
|**Sensor update failed** | There was an error installing the update.| Installation error |Open a support ticket. |
| **Unstable traffic to Azure**|Sensor’s connection to Azure is unstable |Unstable traffic to Azure | We recommend that you check the sensor WAN connection, the BW limit settings, and validate network equipment that might be on the route between the sensor and the cloud.|
| **Unsupported**|Outdated software may result in a non-optimal experience |Sensor version is outdated |Upgrade your sensor software to the latest version to use the most recently available Defender for IoT features.|
|**Sensor is partially connected** |The message is one of the following:<br><br>- **General endpoint error**: Failed to establish a connection with the endpoint/endpoints (specifying the domain name).<br>- DNS endpoint error: Failed to resolve the DNS name of the endpoint/endpoints (specifying the domain name).<br>- **SSL endpoint error**: Failed to establish a secure connection with the endpoint/endpoints (specifying the domain name). The presented certificate is not trusted.<br>- **Proxy authentication endpoint error**:<br><br>For one endpoint: The proxy requires authentication but none or incorrect credentials were provided.<br>For multiple endpoints: Verify the authentication credentials with your proxy administrator. Provide the required credentials in the System Settings screen.<br><br>- **Proxy unnecessary endpoint error**:<br><br>For one endpoint: Unnecessary credentials were provided to the proxy.<br>For multiple endpoints: Remove the username and password provided in the proxy configuration. |- **General endpoint error**: Verify that all the required endpoints are allowed in the firewall with your network team.<br>- **DNS endpoint error**: If the DNS server is reachable, verify the DNS server configured on the sensor is correct. If it is, reach out to your DNS administrator.<br>- **SSL endpoint error**:<br><br>For one endpoint: Make sure the time is configured correctly.<br>For multiple endpoints: Check if you are using SSL inspection service (usually in the proxy). If so, make sure to upload the relevant certificate in the System Settings screen.<br><br>- **Proxy authentication endpoint error**: Verify the authentication credentials with your proxy administrator. Provide the required credentials in the System Settings screen.<br><br>- **Proxy unnecessary endpoint error**: Remove the username and password provided in the proxy configuration. |
|**Backup error** |Failed to backup to Azure storage. |Failed to backup to Azure storage. |The primary causes of backup failures are issues with the sensor's network connectivity or an overly large backup file. Please verify the sensor's network connection and ensure it is not overloaded. |

## Healthy messages

|Title  |Message  |Description  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Pending activation** |Waiting for sensor to connect for the first time |Pending activation | Upload the activation file to the sensor. If this doesn't resolve the problem, verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure.|
|**Pending reactivation** |Waiting for reactivation with new license |Pending reactivation |Upload the new activation file to the sensor. If this doesn't resolve the problem, verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure. |

## Next steps

Remediate each error as recommended. For more information, see [Manage sensors with Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md).
