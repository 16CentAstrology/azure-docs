# Serverless GPU compute in Microsoft Dev Box

Microsoft Dev Box serverless GPU compute enables developers to access powerful GPU resources on demand without requiring permanent infrastructure provisioning or complex setup. This article explains what serverless GPU compute is, how it works, and key scenarios for its use.

## What is serverless GPU compute?

Serverless GPU compute in Microsoft Dev Box provides on-demand access to GPU resources for compute-intensive workloads like AI model training, inference, and data processing. Unlike traditional GPU provisioning that requires long-term commitments and upfront investments, serverless GPU compute allows you to:

- Access GPU resources only when needed
- Scale GPU resources according to workload demands
- Pay only for actual GPU usage
- Work within your organization's secure network environment

This capability integrates Microsoft Dev Box with Azure Container Apps to deliver GPU power without requiring developers to create or manage the underlying infrastructure.

## When to use serverless GPU compute

Consider using serverless GPU compute in Dev Box for scenarios like:

- **AI model development**: Train, fine-tune, and run inference with machine learning models
- **Data processing**: Accelerate processing and transformation of large datasets
- **High-performance computing (HPC)**: Run simulations, scientific computations, and other resource-intensive tasks
- **Cloud-native development**: Scale GPU resources for containerized workflows in AI and beyond
- **CLI-based workflows**: Leverage GPUs for any command-line task that benefits from intensive compute

## Key benefits

### For developers

- **No setup required**: Access GPU compute with a single click from your Dev Box environment
- **No permission barriers**: Use GPU resources without needing rights to create cloud infrastructure
- **Integrated development experience**: Seamlessly use GPU compute within familiar tools like Windows Terminal, Visual Studio, and VS Code
- **Zero configuration**: GPU sessions start automatically when needed and shut down when not in use

### For organizations

- **Cost optimization**: Pay only for actual GPU usage rather than provisioning dedicated hardware
- **Centralized control**: Manage GPU access through project-level policies
- **Security and compliance**: Keep sensitive data within your secure corporate network while using GPU resources
- **Simplified resource management**: Control GPU usage limits at the project level

## How serverless GPU compute works

Serverless GPU compute in Dev Box uses Azure Container Apps (ACA) to provide GPU resources on demand. When a developer launches a GPU-enabled shell or tool, Dev Box automatically:

1. Creates a connection to a serverless GPU session
2. Provisions the necessary GPU resources
3. Makes those resources available through the developer's terminal or integrated development environment
4. Automatically terminates the session when no longer needed

### Available GPU types

The following GPU options are currently supported:

- NVIDIA T4 GPUs

### Developer experience

Developers can access serverless GPU compute through:

- **Windows Terminal**: Launch a GPU-powered shell directly from Windows Terminal
- **Visual Studio**: Access GPU compute from within the Visual Studio environment
- **VS Code with AI Toolkit**: Use seamless GPU integration for AI development tasks

## Administration and management

Administrators control serverless GPU access at the project level through Dev Center. Key management capabilities include:

- **Enable/disable GPU access**: Control whether projects can use serverless GPU resources
- **Set concurrent GPU limits**: Specify the maximum number of GPUs that can be used simultaneously across a project
- **Cost controls**: Manage GPU usage within subscription quotas
