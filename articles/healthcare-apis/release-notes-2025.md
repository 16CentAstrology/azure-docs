# Release notes 2025: Azure Health Data Services

This article describes features, enhancements, and bug fixes released in 2025 for the FHIR&reg; service, Azure API for FHIR, DICOM&reg; service, and MedTech service in Azure Health Data Services.

## January 2025

### FHIR service

#### Enhancement: Improved error handling and validation

HTTP Method Validation for Transaction Bundle Requests:
Added validation to ensure the HTTP method in the Request component of the transaction bundle is a valid HTTPVerb enum value. If the HTTP method is invalid or null, a `RequestNotValidException` is thrown with a `400 Bad Request` status, providing a clearer error message to users.

CMK Error Handling: Improved error handling for operations dependent on customer-managed keys. Users will now see a more specific error message and a link to [Microsoft's troubleshooting guide](fhir/configure-customer-managed-keys.md) if issues occur related to CMK.
