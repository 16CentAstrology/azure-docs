# CustomerIntent: As an industrial edge developer or operations engineer, I want to understand how to use OPC UA Write to send data to OPC UA assets for process control and integration.

# Introduction

OPC UA Write (Preview) empowers industrial developers and operations engineers to perform real-time control at the edge by writing values directly to OPC UA nodes. 
This capability enables immediate updates to configurations, triggers for automation, and dynamic process adjustments—without relying on cloud round-trips.

It is especially useful in scenarios where latency, autonomy, or local decision-making is critical, such as in manufacturing lines, predictive maintenance, or AI-driven control loops.


# Writing Data to OPC UA Assets

Once an asset is deployed, you can use the OPC UA Connector to perform write operations directly to the asset’s OPC UA server, by leveraging remote MQTT calls. 
When an MQTT request is received, the OPC UA Connector dynamically creates an ad-hoc session using the asset’s AssetEndpointProfile (AEP). 
During this session, it performs strict validation to ensure that the write payload only includes data points defined in the target dataset. 
Once validated, the OPC UA Connector executes the write operation, updating the specified nodes on the OPC UA asset. 
Each MQTT message includes Message Metadata that defines system-level and user-defined properties—such as SourceId, ProtocolVersion, and CorrelationData—to ensure traceability and conformance.

Note: In the current preview phase, write operations are limited to data points that are explicitly defined in a dataset.

The OPC UA Connector subscribes to the topic:
{AioNamespace}/asset-operations/{AssetId}/{DatasetName}/
When a write request is received, the OPC UA Connector:

- Creates an ad-hoc session using the asset’s AssetEndpointProfile (AEP).
- Validates the payload to ensure all data points exist within the defined dataset.
- Executes the write by sending the values to the OPC UA Server, which updates the target nodes and returns a success or failure response. 
Note: The changed value is transmitted via the standard telemetry topic associated with the dataset.


# How It Works
1. Asset Setup: Deploy the asset and define its AssetEndpointProfile (AEP) in the Azure Device Registry.
2. Write Request: Send a JSON payload to the MQTT topic using MQTT v5 request/response, specifying the dataset name and the values to be written.
3. Session Creation: OPC UA Connector creates a temporary session using the AEP.
4. Validation: The payload is checked to ensure all data points exist in the dataset.
5. Execution: The values are written to the OPC UA server, and a response is returned.


# Sample Write Payload

Here’s a minimal example for writing a simple float value to a node:

{ 
   "SetPoint": 50
}
