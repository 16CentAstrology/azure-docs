# What is Azure IoT Operations?

_Azure IoT Operations_ is a unified data plane for the edge, offering modular and scalable data services on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters like [AKS Edge Essentials](#supported-environments). This article explores its features, benefits, and use cases.

Azure IoT Operations:

* Is built from the ground up using Kubernetes-native applications.
* Is part of the Microsoft [adaptive cloud approach](/azure/adaptive-cloud/) that unifies siloed teams, distributed sites, and disparate systems into a single operations, security, application, and data model.
* Includes an industrial grade, edge-native MQTT broker that powers event-driven architectures.
* Is highly extensible, scalable, resilient, and secure.
* Lets you manage edge services and resources from the cloud by using [Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/overview).
* Can integrate customer workloads into the platform to create a unified solution.
* Natively integrates with [Azure Event Hubs](../event-hubs/azure-event-hubs-apache-kafka-overview.md), [Azure Event Grid's MQTT broker](../event-grid/mqtt-overview.md), and [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/) in the cloud.

Use Azure IoT Operations to:

* Improve business efficiency and decision-making by using AI in the cloud to analyze asset and equipment data from the edge. Azure IoT Operations processes and normalizes the data at the edge before it's sent to the cloud.
* Transform manufacturing environments by removing barriers between OT and IT systems. Azure IoT Operations supports open standards such as MQTT and OPC UA, and frameworks such as Kubernetes that enable it to foster interoperability and run processes like predictive maintenance, energy optimization, and digital inspection.
* Modernize on-premises and edge infrastructure to handle digital operations. Azure IoT Operations offers a suite of services that enable you to connect, manage, and receive data from your assets.
* Secure your end-to-end operations by using Azure security capabilities. Azure IoT Operations includes built-in security features like secrets management, certificate management, and secure settings.

## Example use cases

Use Azure IoT Operations to address scenarios such as:

### Anomaly detection

To identify anomalies in the data generated by an industrial asset, an operator can use the operations experience web UI to:

* Connect an OPC UA asset to the Azure IoT Operations MQTT broker at the edge.
* Define a data flow that processes and normalizes the data before identifying any anomalies.
* Send the processed data to Microsoft Fabric in the cloud.

Use Microsoft Fabric to build real-time dashboards with visualizations that show the status of the asset and alerts for detected anomalies. You can make these dashboards available on the shop floor where operators can use them to take immediate action and mitigate potential issues. Using predictive analytics and data on the edge helps anticipate failures before they occur and reduces downtime and maintenance costs.

### Operational equipment effectiveness

With Azure IoT Operations, you can use data collected from assets and equipment to improve your operational equipment effectiveness. Azure IoT Operations captures real-time data at the edge and processes it, enabling monitoring of key performance indicators such as availability, performance, and quality. Use Azure IoT Operations to normalize and analyze the data to identify patterns and areas for improvement.

## Architecture overview

<!-- Art Library Source# ConceptArt-0-000-077 -->

:::image type="content" source="media/overview-iot-operations/azure-iot-operations-architecture.svg" alt-text="Diagram of the high-level architecture of Azure IoT Operations, showing its core components and data flow." lightbox="media/overview-iot-operations/azure-iot-operations-architecture.png" border="false":::

Azure IoT Operations architecture has two core elements:

* **Azure IoT Operations**: A set of data services that run on Azure Arc-enabled edge Kubernetes clusters. These services include:
  * The _MQTT broker_ powers event-driven architectures as an edge-native MQTT broker.
  * The _connector for OPC UA_ simplifies OPC UA communication with servers and other leaf devices.
  * _Data flows_ transform and contextualize data, letting you route messages to various locations, including cloud endpoints.
* The _operations experience_ is a web UI that lets operational technology (OT) users manage assets and data flows in an Azure IoT Operations deployment. IT administrators can use [Azure Arc site manager (preview)](/azure/azure-arc/site-manager/overview) to group Azure IoT Operations instances by physical location, making it easier for OT users to find instances.

## Deploy

Azure IoT Operations runs on Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters on the edge. Deploy Azure IoT Operations by using the Azure portal or the Azure CLI.

## Manage devices and assets

Azure IoT Operations connects to various industrial devices and assets. Use the [operations experience](discover-manage-assets/howto-configure-opc-ua.md) or the [Azure CLI](discover-manage-assets/howto-configure-opc-ua.md) to manage the devices and assets you want to connect to.

The [connector for OPC UA](discover-manage-assets/overview-opc-ua-connector.md) manages connections to OPC UA servers and other leaf devices. It publishes data from OPC UA servers to MQTT broker topics.

Azure IoT Operations uses the Azure Device Registry to store information about local assets in the cloud. The service lets you [manage assets on the edge from the Azure portal or the Azure CLI](discover-manage-assets/howto-secure-assets.md). The Azure Device Registry uses _namespaces (preview)_ to organize assets and devices. Each Azure IoT Operations instance uses a single namespace for its assets and devices. Multiple instances can share a single namespace.

The Azure Device Registry includes a schema registry for assets. Data flows use these schemas to deserialize and serialize messages.

## Automatic asset discovery

Automatic asset discovery with Akri services, Azure Device Registry, the connector for OPC UA, the connection for ONVIF (preview), and the media connector (preview) is available in the current version of Azure IoT Operations. Currently, no user-configurable scenarios exist for Akri services in the operations experience web UI for automatic asset discovery.

To learn more, see the [release notes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-operations/releases) for the current version.

If you use a previous preview version of Azure IoT Operations, find the Akri services documentation on the [previous versions site](/previous-versions/azure/iot-operations/discover-manage-assets/overview-akri).

## Publish and subscribe with MQTT

The [MQTT broker](manage-mqtt-broker/overview-broker.md) runs on the edge and lets you publish and subscribe to MQTT topics. Use the MQTT broker to build event-driven architectures that connect devices and assets to the cloud.

Examples of how components in Azure IoT Operations use the MQTT broker include:

* The connector for OPC UA publishes data from OPC UA servers and leaf devices to MQTT topics.
* Data flows subscribe to MQTT topics to retrieve messages, process them, and send them to cloud endpoints.

## Connect to the cloud

To connect to the cloud from Azure IoT Operations, you can use the following data flow destination endpoints:

* [Azure Event Grid and other cloud-based MQTT brokers](connect-to-cloud/howto-configure-mqtt-endpoint.md)
* [Azure Event Hubs or Kafka](connect-to-cloud/howto-configure-kafka-endpoint.md)
* [Azure Data Lake Storage](connect-to-cloud/howto-configure-adlsv2-endpoint.md)
* [Microsoft Fabric OneLake](connect-to-cloud/howto-configure-fabric-endpoint.md)
* [Azure Data Explorer](connect-to-cloud/howto-configure-adx-endpoint.md)

## Offline support

Azure IoT Operations supports a maximum offline time of 72 hours. Degradation might occur during this period. However, Azure IoT Operations resumes full functionality when it reconnects.

## Process data

[Data flows](connect-to-cloud/overview-dataflow.md) enhance data transformation and contextualization capabilities within Azure IoT Operations. Data flows use schemas in the schema registry to deserialize and serialize messages.

## Visualize and analyze sensor data

To visualize and analyze sensor data and messages from your devices and assets, use cloud services like:

* [Microsoft Fabric](/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial)
* [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)

## Secure communication

Secure communication between devices and the cloud by using isolated network environments based on the ISA-95/Purdue network architecture. Use the Azure IoT layered network management (preview) component.
