# Interpret the AppCAT 7 report
This document guides you through the AppCAT report to help you well understand it for assessing the migration readiness of your Java application to Azure. The report generated by appcat provides a comprehensive overview of the application and its components. You can use this report to gain insights into the structure and dependencies of the application, and to determine its suitability for replatform and modernization.
## Application list view
The landing page of the report presents a overall view of all analyzed applications. From here, you can navigate to individual application reports to explore detailed findings.
