# Create and manage projects

This article describes how to create, manage, and delete [projects](migrate-services-overview.md). 

This article shows you how to create, manage, and delete projects. A project is used to store discovery, business case, assessment, and migration metadata collected from the environment you're assessing or migrating. Within a project, you can track discovered assets, create business cases, conduct assessments, and orchestrate migrations to Azure.

## Verify permissions

Ensure you have the correct permissions to create a project using the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, open the relevant subscription, and selectâ€¯**Access control (IAM)**.
2. In **Check access**, find the relevant account, and select it and view permissions. You should have *Contributor* or *Owner* permissions. 


## Create a project for the first time

Set up a new project in an Azure subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, search for *Azure Migrate*.
2. In **Services**, select **Azure Migrate**.
3. In **Get started**, select **Discover, assess and migrate**.

4. In **Create project**, select the Azure subscription and resource group. Create a resource group if you don't have one.
5. In **Project Details**, specify the project name and the geography in which you want to create the project.
    - The region is only used to store the metadata gathered from on-premises servers. You can assess or migrate servers for any target region regardless of the selected region.
    - Review supported regions for [public](supported-geographies.md#public-cloud) and [government clouds](supported-geographies.md#azure-government). 

    > [!Note]
    > Use the **Advanced** configuration section to create an Azure Migrate project with private endpoint connectivity. [Learn more](discover-and-assess-using-private-endpoints.md#create-a-project-with-private-endpoint-connectivity). 

7. Select **Create**.
