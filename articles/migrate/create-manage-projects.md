# Create and manage projects

::: moniker range="migrate"

This article describes how to create, manage, and delete [projects](migrate-services-overview.md). 

This article shows you how to create, manage, and delete projects. A project is used to store discovery, business case, assessment, and migration metadata collected from the environment you're assessing or migrating. Within a project, you can track discovered assets, create business cases, conduct assessments, and orchestrate migrations to Azure.

This article describes how to create, manage, and delete [projects](migrate-services-overview.md).

Classic Azure Migrate is retiring in Feb 2024. After Feb 2024, the classic version of Azure Migrate will no longer be supported and the inventory metadata in the classic project will be deleted. If you're using classic projects, delete those projects and follow the steps to create a new project. You can't upgrade classic projects or components to Azure Migrate. View [FAQ](./resources-faq.md#i-have-a-project-with-the-previous-classic-experience-of-azure-migrate-how-do-i-start-using-the-new-version) before you start the creation process.

A project is used to store discovery, assessment, and migration metadata collected from the environment you're assessing or migrating. In a project, you can track discovered assets, create assessments, and orchestrate migrations to Azure.

## Verify permissions

Ensure you have the correct permissions to create a project using the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, open the relevant subscription, and selectâ€¯**Access control (IAM)**.
2. In **Check access**, find the relevant account, and select it and view permissions. You should have *Contributor* or *Owner* permissions. 

## Create a project for the first time

::: moniker range="migrate"
Set up a new project in an Azure subscription.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-manage-projects/create-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to create project." lightbox="./media/create-manage-projects/create-project.png" :::

4. In **Create project**, select the Azure subscription and resource group. Create a resource group if you don't have one.
5. In **Project Details**, specify the project name and the geography in which you want to create the project.
    - The region is only used to store the metadata gathered from on-premises servers. You can assess or migrate servers for any target region regardless of the selected region.
    - Review supported regions for [public](supported-geographies.md#public-cloud) and [government clouds](supported-geographies.md#azure-government).

::: moniker range="migrate-classic"

To delete a project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Azure resource group in which the project was created.
2. In the Resource Groups page, select **Show hidden types**.
3. Select the project that you want to delete and its associated resources.
    - The resource type is **Microsoft.Migrate/migrateprojects**.
    - If the resource group is exclusively used by the project, you can delete the entire resource group.
        
    >[!NOTE]
    > - When you delete, both the project and the metadata about discovered servers are deleted.
    > - If you're using the older version of Azure Migrate, open the Azure resource group in which the project was created. Select the project you want to delete (the resource type is **Migration project**).
    > - If you're using dependency analysis with an Azure Log Analytics workspace:
    > - If you've attached a Log Analytics workspace to the Server Assessment tool, the workspace isn't automatically deleted. The same Log Analytics workspace can be used for multiple scenarios.
    > - If you want to delete the Log Analytics workspace, do that manually.
    > - Project deletion is irreversible. Deleted objects can't be recovered.

### Delete a workspace manually

1. Browse to the Log Analytics workspace attached to the project.

    - If you haven't deleted the project, you can find the link to the workspace in **Essentials** > **Server Assessment**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-manage-projects/loganalytics-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Log Analytics Workspace.":::

    - If you've already deleted the project, select **Resource Groups** in the left pane of the Azure portal and find the workspace.

2. [Follow the instructions](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/delete-workspace) to delete the workspace.
