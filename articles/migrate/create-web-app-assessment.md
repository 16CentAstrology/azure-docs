# Create a web app assessment for modernization 

This article shows you how to create a web app assessment for modernization to [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) or Azure App Service using Azure Migrate. Creating an assessment for your web apps provides the recommended targets for them and key insights such as app-readiness, target right-sizing and cost to host and run these apps month over month. 

In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to: 

- Set up your Azure Migrate environment to assess web apps. 
- Choose a set of related web applications discovered using the Azure Migrate appliance. 
- Provide assessment configurations such as preferred Azure targets, target region, Azure reserved Instances. 
- Create web app assessment with a recommended modernization path. 

## Prerequisites 

- Deploy and configure the Azure Migrate appliance in your [VMware](./vmware/tutorial-discover-vmware.md), [Hyper-V](tutorial-discover-hyper-v.md), or [physical](tutorial-discover-physical.md) environments. 
- Check the [appliance requirements](migrate-appliance.md#appliance---vmware) and [URL access](migrate-appliance.md#url-access) to be provided. 

## Discover web apps

Follow these steps to discover web apps running on your environment. 
1. Create a workload assessment for web apps.
1. On the Azure Migrate project overview page, under Decide and Plan, select Assessments. 
1. On this page, select Create assessment.
1. Provide a suitable name for the assessment and select Add workloads. 
1. Use appropriate filters, select web apps and select Add. 
1. After reviewing selected workloads, select Next. 
1. On the General settings tab, modify assessment settings that are applicable across all Azure targets.
