# Azure Migrate support matrix

You can use the [Azure Migrate service](./migrate-services-overview.md) to assess and migrate servers to the Microsoft Azure cloud. This article summarizes general support settings and limitations for Azure Migrate scenarios and deployments.

## Supported assessment/migration scenarios

The table summarizes supported discovery, assessment, and migration scenarios.

**Deployment** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Discovery** | You can discover server metadata, and dynamic performance data.
**Software inventory** | You can discover apps, roles, and features running on VMware VMs. Currently this feature is limited to discovery only. Assessment is currently at the server level. We don't yet offer app, role, or feature-based assessments.
**Assessment** | Assess on-premises workloads and data running on VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, and physical servers. Assess using Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment, Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA), as well as other tools and ISV offerings.
**Migration** | Migrate workloads and data running on physical servers, VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, and cloud-based VMS to Azure. Migrate using the Migration and modernization tool and Azure Database Migration Service (DMS), and well as other tools and ISV offerings.

## Project

**Support** | **Details**
--- | ---
Subscription | Can have multiple projects within a subscription.
Azure permissions | Users need Contributor or Owner permissions in the subscription to create a project.
VMware VMs  | Assess up to 35,000 VMware VMs in a single project.
Hyper-V VMs    | Assess up to 35,000 Hyper-V VMs in a single project.

A project can include both VMware VMs and Hyper-V VMs, up to the assessment limits.

## Azure permissions

For Azure Migrate to work with Azure you need these permissions before you start assessing and migrating servers.

**Task** | **Permissions** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
Create a project | Your Azure account needs permissions to create a project. | Set up for [VMware](tutorial-discover-vmware.md#prepare-an-azure-user-account), [Hyper-V](./tutorial-discover-hyper-v.md#prepare-an-azure-user-account), or [physical servers](./tutorial-discover-physical.md#prepare-an-azure-user-account).
Register the Azure Migrate appliance| Azure Migrate uses a lightweight [Azure Migrate appliance](migrate-appliance.md) to discover and assess servers with Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment, and to run [agentless migration](server-migrate-overview.md) of VMware VMs with the Migration and modernization tool. This appliance discovers servers, and sends metadata and performance data to Azure Migrate.<br><br> During registration, register providers (Microsoft.OffAzure, Microsoft.Migrate, and Microsoft.KeyVault) are registered with the subscription chosen in the appliance, so that the subscription works with the resource provider. To register, you need Contributor or Owner access on the subscription.<br><br> **VMware**-During onboarding, Azure Migrate creates two Microsoft Entra apps. The first app communicates between the appliance agents and the Azure Migrate service. The app doesn't have permissions to make Azure resource management calls or have Azure RBAC access for resources. The second app accesses an Azure Key Vault created in the user subscription for agentless VMware migration only. In agentless migration, Azure Migrate creates a Key Vault to manage access keys to the replication storage account in your subscription. It has Azure RBAC access on the Azure Key Vault (in the customer tenant) when discovery is initiated from the appliance.<br><br> **Hyper-V**-During onboarding. Azure Migrate creates one Microsoft Entra app. The app communicates between the appliance agents and the Azure Migrate service. The app doesn't have permissions to make Azure resource management calls or have Azure RBAC access for resources. | Set up for [VMware](tutorial-discover-vmware.md#prepare-an-azure-user-account), [Hyper-V](./tutorial-discover-hyper-v.md#prepare-an-azure-user-account), or [physical servers](./tutorial-discover-physical.md#prepare-an-azure-user-account).
Create a key vault for VMware agentless migration | To migrate VMware VMs with agentless Migration and modernization, Azure Migrate creates a Key Vault to manage access keys to the replication storage account in your subscription. To create the vault, you set permissions (Owner, or Contributor and User Access Administrator) on the resource group where the project resides. | [Set up](tutorial-discover-vmware.md#prepare-an-azure-user-account) permissions.


## VMware assessment and migration

[Review](migrate-support-matrix-vmware.md) the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Migration and modernization support matrix for VMware VMs.

## Hyper-V assessment and migration

[Review](migrate-support-matrix-hyper-v.md) the Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment and Migration and modernization support matrix for Hyper-V VMs.

## Next steps

- [Assess VMware VMs](./tutorial-assess-vmware-azure-vm.md) for migration.
- [Assess Hyper-V VMs](tutorial-assess-hyper-v.md) for migration.
