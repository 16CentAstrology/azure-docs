# Overview

The enhanced agent-based migration stack specifically designed for physical and VMware environments. The upgraded stack offers several significant benefits, such as:

1.  It enables the migration of newer Linux distributions to Azure, expanding the range of supported operating systems and ensuring that customers can leverage the latest advancements in Linux technology. 
1. The stack utilizes Windows Server 2019 (WS2019) for the replication appliance.\
1. The upgraded stack offers a unified OS support matrix. This means that customers can benefit from a consistent and streamlined approach to operating system support across their migration processes.

The upgraded agent-based migration stack provides customers with the tools and capabilities to efficiently migrate newer Linux distributions, utilize WS2019 for replication, and enjoy a unified OS support matrix, enhancing the overall migration process to Azure.
