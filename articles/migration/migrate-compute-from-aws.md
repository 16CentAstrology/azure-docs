# Migrate compute from Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Many workloads contain compute components, such as virtual machines, container hosts, or PaaS services. These compute components host your custom code or commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions. Microsoft Azure has guidance to help you migrate your application platform.

## Azure service awareness

If you haven't yet selected your application platform in Azure, review the [Azure for AWS professionals guide](/azure/architecture/aws-professional/), which has a service mapping available for compute. This is a list that maps similar services between the two cloud providers.

See, the [Azure compute services map](/azure/architecture/aws-professional/compute).

## Scenarios and component guides

Microsoft publishes guidance for select services to help architects, developers, and database administrators plan their migration efforts. Use these guides, combined with guidance available for your other components, to assess, plan, and perform your migration.

### TODO: Organize and present key migration content available for this technology area

## Additional workload components

Your workload contains other components as well that will need to migrate with your compute. Microsoft has similar guidance for:

- [Databases, Data, and AI](./migrate-databases-from-aws.md)
- [Storage](./migrate-storage-from-aws.md)
- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Networking
- Messaging and integration
- Security

Use the table of contents to explore other topics related to your workload's architecture.
