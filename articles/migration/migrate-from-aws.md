# Migrate from Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Migrating a workload from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Azure typically follows the following steps:

1. Assessing your current workload in AWS
1. Designing a similar solution in Azure
1. Preparing the workload and Azure for migration
1. Performing the migration
1. Evaluating success

These general steps are applicable for custom applications as well as for commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions. Once on Azure, you can then further optimize your workload with services and features that will benefit your workload and its users.

Microsoft Azure has a collection of articles that can help guide you with some of these steps to have a successful migration.

## Migration guidance

You'll need to make sure you've established a strong foundation on Azure. Follow the Azure adoption guidance in the [Cloud Adoption Framework](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/get-started/) to build a solid platform for any workloads you'll be migrating.

If you're new to designing workloads in Azure, be sure to start with the basics by reviewing the content in the [Azure for AWS professionals guide](/azure/architecture/aws-professional/). This guide will help you map technology that you are familar with to similar services available on Azure.

For a quick start on migration training, use the [Introduction to migrating from Amazon Web Services to Microsoft Azure](/training/modules/introduction-to-migrating-aws-to-azure/) module on Microsoft Learn.

### Learn through examples

Migration is typically planed and executed at the workload level, not technology by technology. Here are some end-to-end guides that address example workload migrations that cover a combination of application platform, data platforms, and other workload concerns. Use these examples to help you plan your workload migrations.

### TODO: LIST key "end to end" examples that are available.

### Service guides

While migration is typically addressed at the workload level, it's important that architects, software engineers, and data professionals have an understanding of service level migration concerns as well. Use these service level guides to help drive assessment, prepration, and migration steps.

### TODO Do a flyover of the available guidance
