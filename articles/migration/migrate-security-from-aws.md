These scenarios cover common tasks like creating and maintaining users, enforcing multifactor authentication, managing device access, managing applications and secrets, and configuring other security tools.

|--|--|--|
| [Migrate your SIEM in AWS to Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/migration) |  SIEM data in AWS -> Microsoft Sentinel | Discover the reasons for migrating from a legacy SIEM, and learn how to plan out the different phases of your migration. |

## Related workload components

Security services make up only part of your cloud workload. Explore other components you might migrate:

- [Compute](migrate-compute-from-aws.md)
- [Databases](migrate-databases-from-aws.md)
- [Storage](migrate-storage-from-aws.md)
- [Networking](migrate-networking-from-aws.md)

Migrating security scenarios require identity to be a central service. Compare AWS identityâ€¯services used in the workload to their closest Azure counterparts.
