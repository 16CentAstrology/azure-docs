# What is Azure Native Pure Storage Cloud?

[!INCLUDE [what-is](../includes/what-is.md)]

Microsoft and Pure Storage Cloud developed this service and manage it together.

Access Azure Native Pure Storage Cloud from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

This offering provides enterprise-class cloud block storage with built-in cloud capabilities powered by a common Purity operating environment. Pure Storage decouples storage and compute resources, which allows customers with large data footprints to optimize their cloud spend and avoid paying for unnecessary compute power.

## Capabilities

Here are the key capabilities provided by the Pure Storage Cloud integration:

- **Elastic capacity** - Pay for the capacity you use.
- **Flexible performance** - Scale independently from capacity.
- **Thin provisioning** - Allocate space dynamically.
- **Instant resizing** - Adjust storage volumes without downtime or disruption.
- **Flexible volumes** - Multiple hosts can simultaneously access the same storage volume.
- **Snapshots** - Quickly recover from data loss or corruption.
