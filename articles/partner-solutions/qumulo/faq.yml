      - question: What is the difference between Azure Native Qumulo (ANQ) and Cloud Native Qumulo (CNQ)?
        answer: |
            Azure Native Qumulo (ANQ) is a co-developed service by Microsoft and Qumulo, offered and managed as a fully managed Storage-as-a-Service. ANQ manages the underlying infrastructure and software automatically, relieving the customer from day-to-day service management and administration. 
            Cloud Native Qumulo (CNQ) on Microsoft Azure uses the same technology as ANQ but operates as a user-managed Platform-as-a-Service system within the customerâ€™s tenant. CNQ users manually control the architectural resources. Elastic performance is managed through the system controls and capacity expands dynamically as the organization adds more data.
