# Supported Colormaps in Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro

The Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC) Pro Data Explorer allows GeoCatalog users to visualize the geospatial datasets in their collections. In order to properly render these datasets, MPC Pro uses user-specified collection render configurations. These render configurations support various colormaps, which map geospatial raster data values to color channels. The user can specify the use of any of these supported named colormaps when creating their collection render configuration

## Use cases

It's important to understand which colormaps are supported in MPC Pro when specifying the render configurations for a GeoCatalog Collection.
