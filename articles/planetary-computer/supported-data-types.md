# Supported data types in Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro

Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro allows for ingestion and storage of all kinds of data, but only certain file types enable you to take advantage of the full suite of Microsoft Planetary Computer (MPC) Pro features. The following file formats are supported, and automatically cloud optimized, indexed, and made available for visualization upon ingestion:

## Use cases

It's important to understand which geospatial data formats are supported in MPC Pro when performing the following actions:
- Creating STAC (Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog) Collections and Ingesting STAC Items
- Visualizing STAC Items in the Data Explorer UI

## Supported geospatial data types
### Raster data formats

* GeoTIFF  
* TIFF  
* COG  
* JPEG  
* JPEG2000  
* PNG  

### Data cube formats

* NetCDF  
* HDF5  
* GRIB2  
* Zarr (coming soon)

### Vector Data Formats

* GeoJSON (coming soon)
* GeoParquet (coming soon)

### Future data types

* Hyperspectral Data  
* 3D/Point Cloud Data
