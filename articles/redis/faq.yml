          What are the Redis licensing changes?
        answer: |
          The Redis open-source project changed to a dual-license model, with support for the Redis Source Available License version 2 (RSALv2) or Server-Side Public License version 1 (SSPLv1). For more information, see the [Redis press release](https://aka.ms/redis/licensingchangepressrelease). Also see the [Microsoft blog post](https://aka.ms/redis/licensechangeblog) on the Redis licensing change].

          Do the Redis RSALv2 and SSPLv1 licenses cover Azure Cache for Redis or Azure Managed Redis?
        answer: |
          No. The RSALv2 and SSPLv1 licenses don't apply to Azure Managed Redis or Azure Cache for Redis. Azure Managed Redis and Azure Cache for Redis remain covered under the Microsoft terms of service.

      - question: |
          Do I need to do anything in response to the Redis licensing change?
