title: Azure Cache for Redis Retirement FAQ
summary: |
  This article covers some basic questions about Azure Managed Redis and Azure Cache for Redis, and how the latest open-source Redis licensing changes affect Azure Redis.

sections:
  - name: Azure Cache for Redis Retirement
    questions:
      - question: What is retiring and when? 

        answer: | 
          All instances of Azure Cache for Redis tiers (Basic, Standard, and Premium) are being retired on September 29, 2028.
       
      - question: What happens to existing Redis instances? How long are they expected run?

        answer: | 
          All existing Redis instances remain available until September 29, 2028. We continue to perform regular maintenance to ensure that all Azure Cache for Redis instances are secure and stable until September 29, 2028. 

      - question: What actions should be taken for Redis instances affected by the retirement announcement?

        answer: | 
          We recommend that you upgrade your current Azure Cache for Redis instances to Azure Managed Redis instances now. Don't wait until the retirement deadline.

      - question: What happens if I don't upgrade to Azure Managed Redis by Oct 2028?

        answer: | 
          All remaining Azure Cache for Redis instances are disabled starting October 1, 2028.

      - question: Why should I upgrade to Azure Managed Redis?

        answer: | 
          Because Azure Managed Redis caches are based on Redis Enterprise caches, they delivers greater performance and are more cost-effective than Azure Cache for Redis.
          - Enterprise features such as active geo-replication and Redis modules.
          - Zone redundant by default and supports up to 99.999% availability.
          - Built to use Microsoft Entra ID, not legacy and less secure access keys.
      #  This almost feels a little redundant with previous
      - question: What is Redis Enterprise and how is it different from what Azure Cache for Redis offers?

        answer: | 
          Azure Cache for Redis is built on a fork of the Redis open source software (OSS). Azure Managed Redis uses the Redis Enterprise software. Redis Enterprise essentially builds on Redis OSS with advanced features designed for scalability, reliability, and enterprise-grade security. 
          
          For more information, see [What is Azure Managed Redis?](../managed-redis/overview.md) to learn more about the architecture and benefits of Azure Managed Redis.

      - question: What changes do I need to make in my applications to connect to and use Azure Managed Redis?

        answer: | 
          Azure Managed Redis is compatible with all Redis client libraries, redis-cli, and Redis insights.
           - All client applications need to update the Redis hostname and access key[PN3.1][SP3.2] from existing Azure Cache for Redis instance to the corresponding Azure Managed Redis instance. 
           - Azure Managed Redis instances are clustered by default, so your application must configure your client library to work with a clustered Redis instance [SP4.1]. Some client libraries like `StackExchange.Redis` don't need any special configuration to connect to clustered Redis. [YM5.1][SP5.2] Azure Managed Redis also supports a non-clustered option up to 25GB, but we recommend configuring your instance with clustering for better performance and room for increasing memory size.

              - [Nodejs](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/nodejs/connect/#connect-to-a-redis-cluster) 
                [Jedis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/jedis/connect/#connect-to-a-redis-cluster)
                [Lettuce](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/lettuce/connect/#connect-to-a-redis-cluster)
                [Redis-py](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/redis-py/connect/#connect-to-a-redis-cluster)
                [Go-redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/clients/go/connect/#connect-to-a-redis-cluster)

           - Most client applications don't need any other changes, unless you're using some [cross-slot commands](https://redis.io/blog/redis-clustering-best-practices-with-keys/). See [Azure Managed Redis Client libraries](best-practices-client-libraries.md) for more info.

      - question: How do I choose the right Azure Managed Redis tier?

        answer: | 
          For more information, see this article on how to choose the right Azure Managed Redis tier and SKU.

      - question: How do I choose the right clustering policy?

        answer: | 
          Azure Managed Redis instance is configured with OSS clustering policy by default. See information here on how to choose clustering policy.

      - question: Does Azure Managed Redis support every feature that is currently in use [SP6.1][YM6.2]?

        answer: | 
          Azure Managed Redis supports all Redis functionality offered in existing Azure Cache for Redis SKUs. Some management operations, regions, and SKU sizes aren't currently available but are coming soon. 
          
          All the timelines mentioned are tentative. Please reach out through support or directly to AzureManagedRedis@microsoft.com for more information.

          If you want to migrate to Azure Managed Redis immediately, but you can't because of any missing feature, reach out to support or send an email to AzureManagedRedis@microsoft.com.

      - question: How do I migrate to Azure Managed Redis now?

        answer: | 
          Given the benefits of using Azure Managed Redis, we highly recommend you migrate to Azure Managed Redis as soon as possible, without waiting for the retirement deadline.

          For step-by-step instructions, see the [migration guide to Azure Managed Redis](/migrate/migrate-overview).

      - question: How do I retain my data during migration?

        answer: | 
          This article outlines various options to migrate your cache endpoint and retain data.

      - question: Is there any tooling to help with the migration to Azure Managed Redis[SP7.1][KC7.2]?

        answer: | 
            A command-line migration tool releases in phases starting October 2025. It helps you connect your new Azure Managed Redis instance using the same cache hostname and access key as your existing Azure Cache for Redis instance.

      - question: Is downtime expected during migration?

        answer: | 
          If you are using the migration tooling, then you should expect a connection blip when the DNS record for your Redis instance is updated to point to the new Azure Managed Redis cache. This blip is a few seconds and should be comparable to the blip that your application experiences during regular maintenance.

      - question: Are reservations or reserved pricing for Azure Cache for Redis transferable to Azure Managed Redis?


        answer: | 
          You can cancel or exchange your existing reservation. For more information, see [Cancel, exchange, and refund policies](/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/exchange-and-refund-azure-reservations).
