# Reliability in Azure API Management

This article describes reliability support in [Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts), covering resiliency of your backend APIs, intra-regional resiliency of the Azure API Management instance via [availability zones](#availability-zone-support), and [multi-region deployments](#multi-region-support).

Resiliency is a shared responsibility between you and Microsoft and so this article also covers ways for you to create a resilient solution that meets your needs.

Azure API Management helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. API Management provides the core competencies to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection. With API Management, you can create and manage modern API gateways for existing backend services hosted anywhere.

## Redundancy

When you deploy an Azure API Management instance, you configure one or more *units*, also called *scale units*. A unit is a logical representation of capacity. The Azure API Management platform provides resiliency even when you have a single unit. To learn more about units, see [Upgrade and scale an Azure API Management instance](../api-management/upgrade-and-scale.md).

When you configure a multi-zone or multi-region Azure API Managment instance, you need to configure enough units so that units can be distributed across the zones or regions.

## Consumption tier reliability

The consumption tier of Azure API Management has built-in resiliency capabilities, and is resilient to a range of faults within a single Azure datacenter. However, the consumption tier doesn't provide support for availability zones or multi-region deployments. To understand the expected uptime of a consumption tier Azure API Management instance, review the [service level agreement](#service-level-agreement).

If you need more resiliency than the consumption tier provides, use a tier that supports the resiliency capabilities you require.

## Production deployment recommendations

- Use Premium (classic) tier with the `stv2` compute platform for your API Management instance. The Premium tier provides the features you need to ensure high availability and reliability for your production workloads.

<!-- TODO would we recommend using multiple scale units? -->

- [Enable zone redundancy](#availability-zone-support), which requires your API Management service to deploy at least one unit in each availability zone. This configuration ensures that your API Management instance is resilient to datacenter-level failures.

- If you use a multi-region deployment, use availability zones to improve the resilience of the primary region. You can also distribute units across availability zones and regions to enhance regional gateway performance.

::: zone pivot="basic,standard,developer,premium-classic,premium-v2"

## Capacity management

To avoid request failures, timeouts, and latency problems, you should proactively monitor the capacity of your gateway by using Azure API Management gateway [capacity metrics](/azure/api-management/api-management-capacity). With capacity metrics you can make scaling decisions when your instance is approaching its maximum capacity. 

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="premium-classic"

If you use [workspaces](../api-management/workspaces-overview.md) to share a single Azure API Management instance between multiple teams, you should use [workspace gateways](../api-management/workspaces-overview.md#workspace-gateway) to isolate and limit the capacity allotted to each workspace. If you don't use workspace gateways, there's a high probability that a single workspace could consume all of the deployed capacity, causing outages or reliability issues for the other workspaces.

::: zone-end

## Transient faults 

[!INCLUDE[introduction to transient faults](includes/reliability-transient-faults-description-include.md)]

All applications should follow Azure's transient fault handling guidance when communicating with any cloud-hosted APIs, databases, and other components. To learn more about handling transient faults, see [Recommendations for handing transient faults](/azure/well-architected/reliability/handle-transient-faults).

### Retries and circuit breakers

When you use Azure API Management in front of an API, you might need to retry requests that fail due to transient requests. To protect your backend API from being overwhelmed by too many requests, [Backends in API Management](../api-management/backends.md) provides you with the ability to create retry and circuit breaker logic to support your API's needs. 

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE[introduction to AZ](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

Azure API Management supports availability zones in both zonal and zone-redundant configurations:

- *Zonal*: The API Management gateway and the control plane of your API Management instance (management API, developer portal, Git configuration) are deployed in a single zone that you select within an Azure region.  

    >[!NOTE] 
    >Pinning to a single zone doesnâ€™t increase resiliency. To improve resiliency, you need to explicitly deploy resources into multiple zones (zone-redundancy). 

- *Zone-redundant*: Enabling zone redundancy for an API Management instance in a supported region provides redundancy for all service components, including the gateway, management plane, and developer portal. Azure automatically replicates all service components across the zones that you select.

### Region support 

To configure availability zones for API Management, your instance must be in one of the [Azure regions that support availability zones](availability-zones-region-support.md).

### Requirements

* Your API Management instance must use the Premium (classic) tier. To upgrade your instance to Premium tier, see [Upgrade to the Premium tier](../api-management/upgrade-and-scale.md#change-your-api-management-service-tier).

* If your API Management instance is deployed (injected) in an [Azure virtual network](/azure/api-management/api-management-using-with-vnet), know which version of the [compute platform is being used - `stv` or `stv2`](/azure/api-management/compute-infrastructure).

::: zone pivot="premium-classic"

### Considerations 

- When you enable zone redundancy in a region, consider how many API Management units that need to be distributed. Minimally, configure the same number of units as the number of availability zones. You must configure API Management units that you can distribute evenly across the zones. For example, if you configure two zones, you can configure two units, four units, or another multiple of two units.

    Use [capacity metrics](/azure/api-management/api-management-capacity) and your own testing to decide the number of units that provide your required gateway performance. For more information about scaling and upgrading your service instance, see [Upgrade and scale an Azure API Management instance](/azure/api-management/upgrade-and-scale).

- If you enable availability zones on an an API Management instance that's configured with autoscaling, you might need to adjust your autoscale settings after configuration. The number of API Management units in autoscale rules and limits must be a multiple of the number of zones.

- When enabling zone redundancy, changes can take 15 to 45 minutes to apply. The API Management gateway can continue to handle API requests during this time.

- When you're enabling zone redundancy on an API Management instance that's deployed in an external or internal virtual network, you can optionally specify a new public IP address resource. In an internal virtual network, the public IP address is used only for management operations, not for API requests. [Learn more about IP addresses of API Management](../api-management/api-management-howto-ip-addresses.md).

- Enabling zone redundancy or changing the availability zone configuration triggers a public and private [IP address change](../api-management/api-management-howto-ip-addresses.md#changes-to-the-ip-addresses).

### Cost

Adding units incurs additional costs. For information, see [API Management pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/api-management/).

### Configure availability zone support 

To enable zone redundancy for an API Management instance, see [Enable zone redundancy for an API Management instance](/azure/api-management/enable-zone-redundancy).

[!INCLUDE [Availability zone numbering](./includes/reliability-availability-zone-numbering-include.md)]

### Capacity planning and management 

Use [capacity metrics](/azure/api-management/api-management-capacity) and your own testing to decide the number of units that provide your required gateway performance. For more information about scaling and upgrading your service instance, see [Upgrade and scale an Azure API Management instance](/azure/api-management/upgrade-and-scale).

In a zone-down scenario, there's no guarantee that requests for additional capacity in another availability zone will succeed. The back filling of lost units occurs on a best-effort basis. If you need guaranteed capacity when an availability zone is lost, you should create and configure your API Management instance to account for losing a zone. You can do that by overprovisioning the capacity of your API Management instance.

### Traffic routing between zones

During normal operations, traffic is routed between all of your available API Management units across all selected availability zones.

### Zone-down experience
<!-- TODO verify with PG -->

**Detection and response:** The Azure API Management platform is responsible for detecting a failure in an availability zone and responding. You don't need to do anything to initiate a zone failover.

**Active requests:** When an availability zone is unavailable, any requests in progress that are connected to an API Management unit in the faulty availability zone are terminated and need to be retried.

**Traffic rerouting:** When a zone is unavailable, Azure API Management detects the lost units from that zone. It automatically attempts to find new replacement units. Then, it spreads traffic across the new units as needed.

### Failback
<!-- TODO confirm with PG -->

When the availability zone recovers, Azure API Management automatically restores units in the availability zone and reroutes traffic between your units as normal.

### Testing for zone failures
<!-- TODO confirm with PG. I assume there's no way to shut down a zonal instance either? -->

The Azure API Management platform manages traffic routing, failover, and failback for zone-redundant API Management instances. Because this feature is fully managed, you don't need to initiate or validate availability zone failure processes.

## Multi-region support

With a multi-region deployment, you can add regional API gateways to an existing API Management instance in one or more supported Azure regions. Multi-region deployment helps to reduce any request latency that's perceived by geographically distributed API consumers. A multi-region deployment also improves service availability if one region goes offline.

When adding a region, you configure:

- The number of units that region will host.

- Optional [availability zones](#availability-zone-support), if that region supports it.

- [Virtual network settings](/azure/api-management/virtual-network-concepts) in the added region, if networking is configured in the existing region or regions.

### Region support 

You can create multi-region deployments with any Azure region that supports Azure API Management.

### Requirements

You must use the Premium (classic) tier to enable multi-region support.

::: zone pivot="premium-classic"

### Considerations

- Only the gateway component of your API Management instance is replicated to multiple regions. The instance's management plane and developer portal remain hosted only in the primary region where you originally deployed the service.

- If you want to configure a secondary location for your API Management instance when it's deployed (injected) in a virtual network, the VNet and subnet region should match with the secondary location you're configuring. If you're adding, removing, or enabling the availability zone in the primary region, or if you're changing the subnet of the primary region, then the VIP address of your API Management instance will change. For more information, see [IP addresses of Azure API Management service](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-ip-addresses#changes-to-the-ip-addresses). However, if you're adding a secondary region, the primary region's VIP won't change because every region has its own private VIP.

- The gateway in each region (including the primary region) has a regional DNS name that follows the URL pattern of `https://<service-name>-<region>-01.regional.azure-api.net`, for example `https://contoso-westus2-01.regional.azure-api.net`.

### Cost

Adding regions incurs additional costs. For information, see [API Management pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/api-management/).

### Configure multi-region support 

To configure multi-region support on an API Management instance, see [Deploy an Azure API Management instance to multiple Azure regions](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region#-deploy-api-management-service-to-an-additional-region).

To remove a region from an API Management instance, see [Remove an Azure API Management service region](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region#-remove-an-api-management-service-region).

### Capacity planning and management 

In a region-down scenario, there's no guarantee that requests for additional capacity in another region will succeed. If you need guaranteed capacity when a region is lost, you should create and configure your API Management instance to account for losing a region. You can do that by overprovisioning the capacity of your API Management instance.

### Traffic routing between regions 

Azure API Management automatically routes incoming requests to a regional gateway. A request is routed to the regional gateway with the lowest latency from the client. If you need to use a different routing approach, you can configure your own Traffic Manager with custom routing rules. For more information, see [Use custom routing to API Management regional gateways](../api-management/api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region.md#-use-custom-routing-to-api-management-regional-gateways).

When a request reaches an Azure API Management regional gateway, it's usually routed to the backend API (unless a policy returns a response directly from the gateway, such as a cached response or an error code). In a multi-region solution, you need to take care to route to an instance of the backend API that meets your performance requirements. For more information, see [Route API calls to regional backend services](../api-management/api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region.md#-route-api-calls-to-regional-backend-services).

### Data replication between regions 

Gateway configuration, such as APIs and policy definitions, are regularly synchronized between the primary and secondary regions you add. Propagation of updates to the regional gateways normally takes less than 10 seconds. Multi-region deployment provides availability of the API gateway in more than one region and provides service availability if one region goes offline.

### Region-down experience 

- **Detection and response**: is responsible for detecting a failure in a region and automatically failing over to a gateway in the secondary region.

- **Active requests**: Any active requests are dropped and should be retried by the client.

- **Expected data loss**: Azure API Management doesn't store data.

    Configuration changes are replicated to each region within approximately 10 seconds. If an outage of your primary region occurs, you might lose configuration changes that haven't been replicated.

- **Expected downtime**: If the primary region goes offline, the API Management management plane and developer portal become unavailable, but secondary regions continue to serve API requests using the most recent gateway configuration. No gateway downtime is expected during a regional failover.

- **Traffic rerouting:** If a region goes offline, API requests are automatically routed around the failed region to the next closest gateway.

### Failback

When the primary region recovers, Azure API Management automatically restores units in the region and reroutes traffic between your units as normal.

### Testing for region failures  

You can simulate a region failure by disabling routing to a regional gateway. To learn more, see [Disable routing to a regional gateway](../api-management/api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region.md#disable-routing-to-a-regional-gateway). Regularly test your responses to region failures so that you can be ready for unexpected region outages.

## Backups

Azure API Management doesn't store data. You can back up your Azure API Management service configuration. Backup and restore operations can also be used for replicating API Management service configuration between operational environments, for example, development and staging. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Runtime data such as users and subscriptions are copied as well, which might not always be desirable.

Backup is supported in Developer, Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers.

For more information on backup in Azure API Management, see [How to implement disaster recovery using service backup and restore in Azure API Management](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-disaster-recovery-backup-restore).

## Service-level agreement

The service-level agreement (SLA) for Azure API Management describes the expected availability of the service. It also describes the conditions that must be met to achieve that availability expectation. To understand those conditions, it's important that you review the [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services).

When you deploy an API Management instance in multiple availability zones or regions, the uptime percentage defined in the SLA increases.
