# Reliability in Azure Firewall

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability.

This article describes reliability support in Azure Firewall, covering intra-regional resiliency via [availability zones](#availability-zone-support) and [multi-region deployments](#multi-region-support).

[!INCLUDE [Shared responsibility description](includes/reliability-shared-responsibility-include.md)]

## Production deployment recommendations

To learn about how to deploy Azure Firewall to support your solution's reliability requirements, and how reliability affects other aspects of your architecture, see [Architecture best practices for Azure Firewall in the Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-firewall).

## Reliability architecture overview

By default, Azure Firewall achieves redundancy through its built-in high availability architecture. The service automatically distributes firewall instances across multiple fault domains within a region, providing protection against server rack and datacenter failures within a single availability zone.

Azure Firewall's reliability architecture includes:

- **Built-in high availability**: No extra load balancers or configuration required
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scales out when average throughput and CPU consumption reaches 60% or connection usage reaches 80%
- **Instance distribution**: When deployed with availability zones, firewall instances are distributed across multiple zones as the service scales
- **Fault tolerance**: Designed to handle localized failures with automatic failover capabilities

The service is designed to handle localized failures and provides automatic failover capabilities without requiring manual intervention.

## Transient faults

[!INCLUDE [Transient fault description](includes/reliability-transient-fault-description-include.md)]

For applications connecting through Azure Firewall, implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle potential transient connection issues. Azure Firewall's stateful nature ensures that legitimate connections are maintained during brief network interruptions.

During scaling operations, which take 5-7 minutes to complete, existing connections are preserved while new firewall instances are added to handle increased load.

## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [AZ support description](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

Azure Firewall can be configured during deployment to span multiple Availability Zones for increased availability. When deployed across multiple availability zones, Azure Firewall provides enhanced reliability and uptime guarantees.

Azure Firewall supports both zone-redundant and zonal deployment models:

- **Zone-redundant**: Firewall instances are automatically distributed across multiple availability zones in the region, and Azure manages load balancing and failover between zones automatically.

    Zone-redundant firewalls achieve the highest uptime SLA, and are recommended for production workloads requiring maximum availability

- **Zonal**: Firewall can be associated with a specific zone, to ensure the firewall is close in proximity to backend servers in order to optimize latency.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Pinning to a single availability zone is only recommended when [cross-zone latency](./availability-zones-overview.md#inter-zone-latency) is too high for your needs, and when you have verified that the latency doesn't meet your requirements. By itself, a zonal firewall doesnâ€™t provide resiliency to an availability zone outage. To improve the resiliency of a zonal Azure Firewall deployment, you need to explicitly deploy separate firewalls into multiple availability zones and configure traffic routing and failover.

If you don't configure a firewall to be zone-redundant or zonal then it's considered to be *nonzonal* or *regional*. Nonzonal firewalls might be placed in any availability zone within the region. If any availability zone in the region experiences an outage, nonzonal firewalls might be in the affected zone and could experience downtime.

### Region support

Azure Firewall supports availability zones in [all regions that support availability zones](../reliability/availability-zones-region-support.md), where the Azure Firewall service is available.

### Requirements

- All tiers of Azure Firewall support availabiity zones.
- For zone-redundant firewalls, you must use standard public IP addresses and you must configure them to be zone-redundant.
- For zonal firewalls, you must use standard public IP addresses and can configure them to either be zone-redundant or zonal in the same zone as the firewall.

### Considerations

- **Deployment-time configuration**: Availability zone configuration can only be set during initial deployment. You can't modify zone settings for existing firewalls.
- **Regional capacity constraints**: Some regions have capacity constraints in specific zones (Physical zone 2 in North Europe and Physical zone 3 in Southeast Asia).

### Cost

There's no extra cost for a firewall deployed in more than one availability zone.

### Configure availability zone support

This section explains how to configure availability zone support for your firewalls.

- **Create a new firewall with availability zone support:** The approach you use to configure availability zones depends on whether you want to create a zone-redundant or zonal firewall.

  - *Zone-redundant:* When you deploy a new firewall, specify two or more availability zones. We recommend that you select all zones so that your gateway can use all of the availability zones, unless you have a specific reason not to use a particular zone.

    For guidance on deploying a new firewall, see these resources:
    - [Deploy an Azure Firewall with Availability Zones using Azure PowerShell](../firewall/deploy-availability-zone-powershell.md)
    - [Deploy Azure Firewall using Azure portal](../firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal.md) and select multiple availability zones during deployment

  - *Zonal:* You can deploy a zonal firewall by following the same deployment methods as for a zone-redundant deployment, but select a single specific availability zone.

    > [!NOTE]
    > [!INCLUDE [Availability zone numbering](./includes/reliability-availability-zone-numbering-include.md)]

- **Change the availability zone configuration of an existing firewall:** Availability zones can only be configured during initial deployment. Existing firewalls can't be converted to use availability zones.

- **Disable availability zone support:** Availability zone support can't be disabled.

### Normal operations

The following section describes what to expect when Azure Firewall is configured with availability zone support and all availability zones are operational:

- **Traffic routing between zones**: When zone-redundant, Azure Firewall automatically distributes traffic across instances in all available zones. The platform manages load balancing without user intervention.

- **Instance distribution and data replication**: As the firewall scales, it creates instances in all configured zones. Azure Firewall automatically replicates configuration and state data across these instances to ensure consistent policy enforcement and seamless failover between zones.

- **Zonal deployments**: For zonal deployments, all traffic gets processed by the firewall instance in the specified zone. If you deploy multiple zonal instances across different zones for improved reliability, you must configure traffic routing using external load balancing solutions like Azure Load Balancer or Traffic Manager.

### Zone-down experience

The following section describes what to expect when Azure Firewall is configured with availability zone support and one or more availability zones are unavailable:

- **Detection and response**: The Azure Firewall platform automatically detects zone failures and manages failover without user intervention
- **Active connections**: Existing connections might experience brief interruption during zone failover, but the stateful nature of Azure Firewall helps maintain session consistency
- **Expected data loss**: No data loss is expected during zone failover as Azure Firewall doesn't store persistent customer data
- **Expected downtime**: Minimal downtime is expected during automatic zone failover. The platform redirects traffic to healthy zones
- **Traffic rerouting**: Traffic is automatically rerouted to healthy availability zones. New firewall instances can be created in surviving zones if needed

For zonal deployments:
- **Single zonal deployment**: Zone failure results in complete firewall unavailability until the zone recovers or you implement failover to backup firewalls in other regions.

### Failback

The failback behavior depends on the availability zone configuration that your firewall uses:

- *Zone-redundant:* When the availability zone recovers, Azure Firewall automatically redistributes instances across all zones used by your firewall and restores normal load balancing across zones.

- *Zonal:* You're responsible for rerouting traffic to the firewall in the original availability zone after the availability zone recovers.

### Testing

The options for testing for zone failures depend on the availability zone configuration that your gateway uses:

- *Zone-redundant:* The Azure Firewall platform manages traffic routing, failover, and failback for zone-redundant firewall resources. You don't need to initiate anything. Because this feature is fully managed, you don't need to validate availability zone failure processes.


- *Zonal:* For zonal deployments with multiple instances across zones, you should regularly test your custom failover and traffic routing mechanisms to ensure they work correctly during zone failures. Consider using Azure Chaos Studio to simulate zone failures and validate your disaster recovery procedures.

## Multi-region support

Azure Firewall is a single-region service. If the region is unavailable, your Azure Firewall resource is also unavailable.

### Alternative multi-region approaches

Since Azure Firewall doesn't have native multi-region capabilities, you must implement a multi-region architecture using separate firewall instances. This approach involves deploying independent Azure Firewall resources in different regions and implementing custom failover logic.

**Architecture pattern:**
1. Deploy separate Azure Firewall instances in each target region
2. Use Azure Firewall Manager for centralized policy management
3. Implement traffic routing using Azure Traffic Manager or Azure Front Door
4. Configure monitoring and automated or manual failover procedures

#### Requirements for multi-region deployments

- Separate Azure Firewall instances must be deployed in each region
- Azure Firewall Policy enables centralized rule management across multiple firewall instances
- Network connectivity between regions must be established using virtual network peering, VPN, or ExpressRoute
- Custom traffic routing and failover mechanisms must be implemented

#### Considerations for multi-region deployments

- Each Azure Firewall instance operates independently within its region
- Firewall rules and policies must be synchronized across regions using Azure Firewall Manager
- User-define routes (UDRs) must be configured to direct traffic to the appropriate regional firewall
- Failover between regions requires manual intervention or custom automation
- Cross-region data transfer charges can apply for traffic between regions

#### Cost implications

You're billed separately for each Azure Firewall instance deployed in different regions. Consider the following cost factors:
- Per-region firewall instance charges
- Cross-region data transfer costs
- Extra networking components (VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute) for inter-region connectivity

For example approaches that illustrate multi-region network security architectures, see:
- [Multi-region load balancing with Traffic Manager, Azure Firewall, and Application Gateway](/azure/architecture/high-availability/reference-architecture-traffic-manager-application-gateway)
- [Hub-spoke network topology in Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/hybrid-networking/hub-spoke)

## Service-level agreement

[!INCLUDE [SLA description](includes/reliability-sla-include.md)]

Azure Firewall offers a higher availability SLA for firewalls that are deployed across multiple availability zones (two or more zones).
