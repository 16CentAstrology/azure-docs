# KQL jobs, Notebook jobs, summary rules, and search jobs

This article compares KQL jobs, Notebook jobs, summary rules, and search jobs in Microsoft Sentinel. These features let you query and analyze data in Microsoft Sentinel, and each serves different purposes and use cases.

>[!NOTE]
> KQL jobs and Notebook jobs require onboarding to the Microsoft Sentinel data lake. For more information, see [Onboard to the Microsoft Sentinel data lake (preview)](./sentinel-lake-onboarding.md).

+ **KQL jobs**: Run one-time or scheduled asynchronous queries on data stored in the Microsoft Sentinel data lake. KQL jobs are best for incident investigations using historical logs, enrichment using low-fidelity logs, and scenarios that need queries with joins or unions across multiple tables. For more information, see [KQL jobs](kql-jobs.md).

+ **Notebook jobs**: Run one-time or scheduled asynchronous queries on data stored in the Microsoft Sentinel data lake. Notebook jobs are a powerful Python-based tool for long-running async queries across large scale logs for security scenarios like anomaly detection, log aggregation, and applying machine learning. The jobs run in the background and can hydrate custom tables in the Microsoft Sentinel data lake or Log Analytics For more information, see [Notebook jobs](notebook-jobs.md).

+ **Summary rules**: Run frequent summarization jobs to aggregate high volume data such as network and firewall logs. Summary rules run in the background and store results in custom tables in the analytics tier.  For more information, see [Summary rules](../summary-rules.md).

+ **Search jobs**: Run one-time, long-running asynchronous queries across large datasets. Search jobs are useful when you need to hydrate large volumes of data from a single table into a new custom table within the analytics tier for further investigation or forensic analysis. For more information, see [Search jobs](../search-jobs.md).

## Usage scenarios and feature choice

The following section helps you decide which feature is best for your needs.

If you have any of the following requirements, use KQL jobs:

+ You need to query up to 12 years of historical data.
+ You need to run complex queries involving full KQL operators including joins or unions.
+ You need scheduled or ad-hoc investigation capabilities.

Use Notebook jobs if any of the following apply:

+ You're onboarded to the Microsoft Sentinel data lake.
+ You require analyzing large-scale data.
+ You want to query historical data of up to 12 years.
+ You need to run complex queries involving joining tables across data lake and analytics tier.
+ You need to store insights in custom tables in data lake or analytics tier.
+ You want to use a wide range of Python libraries, enabling you to use existing tools and frameworks for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

Use summary rules if you have any of the following requirements:

+ Data is in a workspace that isn't onboarded to Microsoft Sentinel data lake, for example data may still reside in Auxiliary or Basic tiers.
+ You need frequent summarization, for example, every 20 minutes.
+ You want to use out-of-the-box summary rules templates.

If you have any of the following requirements, use search jobs:

+ You have data in archive tier. If you're onboarded to Microsoft Sentinel data lake, to access data older than your onboarding date, use search jobs. For data from your onboarding date onward, use KQL jobs.
+ You need to hydrate large volumes of data from a single table.
