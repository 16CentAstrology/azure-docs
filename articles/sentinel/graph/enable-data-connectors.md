#Customer intent: As a Microsoft Sentinel user, I want to enable and manage data connectors in the Microsoft Sentinel data lake so that I can ingest and analyze security-related data from various sources.

# Enable asset data ingestion in the Microsoft Sentinel data lake (preview)

Asset data refers to structured information about digital or physical entities, such as devices, services, applications, or infrastructure components, that are relevant to an organizationâ€™s operations, security, or analytics. This article explains how to enable and manage asset data in Microsoft Sentinel's data lake. Data in the data lake is ingested and managed through data connectors. These data connectors allow you to integrate various data sources into Microsoft Sentinel, enabling enhanced security monitoring and threat detection capabilities.

Asset data ingestion is automatically enabled for anyone with the appropriate permissions in Microsoft Sentinel upon successful provision of the data lake.  The asset data is ingested into the Microsoft Sentinel data lake tier only (not in the analytics tier). If automatic provisioning of the asset data fails due to insufficient permission, only the asset data tables are created in the data lake, but no data is ingested. Users can manually enable ingestion through the *use various asset data sources* connector in the default workspace.

The various connectors are packaged in their respective solutions and can be found in Content Hub.

The following table describes the various asset data sources and their data connectors during Public Preview:

## Prerequisites

To enable and manage asset data connectors, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- Ensure you have the necessary [access and permissions](../roles.md#microsoft-sentinel-roles-permissions-and-allowed-actions) to Microsoft Sentinel, as specified *Permissions* column of the previous table.
- Search for the relevant solution containing the data connector in the Content Hub. Content Hub can be found under the **Microsoft Sentinel** menu **Content Management** > **Content Hub**. Install the solution if not already installed.

## Configure and Manage

Access the connector page in one of the following ways:

- From the installed solution:
  - From the installed solution select **Manage**
  - Select the connector and then **Open connector page**

- From the Connector gallery:
  - The Connector gallery can be found under the **Microsoft Sentinel** menu **Configuration** > **Data connectors**

1. Enable Data Connectors

    Review the prerequisites on the connector page to ensure you meet the permission requirements to manage the connector
