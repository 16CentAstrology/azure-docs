# Unified Connectors Gallery

Microsoft offers customers various security solutions. Each solution targets a different scenario, but they all aim to protect customer environments and assets. There are connectors for data acquisition, remediation, and exposure management.

The Unified connectors platform enables you to connect to several different Microsoft security products using a single connector. This platform simplifies the connector management experience across Microsoft security products.

## Key Benefits

The Unified Connectors Platform offers several key benefits, including

- Reduced Development Overhead and Time-to-Market
- Enhanced Customer Experience
- Connect only once
- Centralized Management
- Enhanced Security
- Cost Reduction
- Streamlined Development for Third-Party Connectors
- Unified Response and Remediation Actions

## Unified services

The unified connectors platform provides unified services shared by all security products to allow consistent development and user experience. This includes the following:

### Collect Once

Different products collect the same data from the same source for different scenarios. For example, Okta Single Sign On system logs are collected every 5 minutes both by Sentinel users and by Microsoft Defender for Identity. Beyond the inefficiency caused by this duplication, it can cause customers to exceed their API rate limit due to the quotas imposed by Okta.

The unified connector solves this problem by unifying two or more products that have similar collection rules and by collecting the data once for all products as illustrated in the following diagram:

### Consistent Single Management across all security products

Users can manage all their connectors in one place through the Unified Security Experience (USX) portal and unified (Graph) API.

### Authenticate Once

The platform provides a unified credentials service to store credentials for all connectors, enhancing security and usability.

### Unified health service

The platform includes a unified health service that provides status, volume graphs, and notifications for all connectors. All health issues are stored to a shared health table that is accessible to all users through [Advanced Hunting](advanced-hunting.md).

### Unified development and testing processes

The platform allows consistent self-service development experience for all connectorsâ€™ developers, including Microsoft teams, partners, ISVs, and end users.

The API and the UI are designed to allow flexibility and agility for partners. For example, one partner might develop connectors for one product and another partner can extend that connector to send data to a different product etc. To ensure quality a shared DoD will be defined to be followed by all partners.

The unified platform also includes a shared testing lab to allow testing scale and functionality once for all products.

### Integration with Microsoft datalake

The platform allows integration with Datalake, including enabling data federation.

## Supported Connectors

Currently, the Unified Connectors Platform is available in preview for [Okta Single Sign-On connectors](./okta-integration.md) shared by Sentinel, MDI and MSEM. 

## Data connectors gallery

The available unified connectors are shown in the [Data connectors Gallery](https://security.microsoft.com/sentinel/unified-connector) **Catalog** tab.

Here you can see all the available unified connectors. There are also links to the product specific connectors. The connectors column of the table indicates how many. The connectors column of the table shows you how many connector instances this connector currently has. The table also shows who supports the connector and who the provider is.

The **My Connectors** tab shows the connectors that are currently configured. The **Unified connectors** tab shows the unified connectors that are available to you. You can select a connector to see its health information and manage it.

:::image type="content" source="./media/unified-connectors/connector-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot of my connectors tab in connectors gallery.":::

Connector health information available in the **My Connectors** tab includes:

- **Name**: The name of the connector.
- **Status**: The status of the connector, such as *OK*, *Warning*, or *Error*.
- **Audit details**: Created and updated information.
- **Workspace**: The workspace to which the connector is connected.
- **Table**: The table that is used by the connector.
- **Last health messages**: The latest error messages.

The Sentinel tab shows the connectors that are available only to Sentinel as the appear in the content hub.

## Considerations and limitations

- The unified connectors scope doesn't include unified data flow. Once the data is collected and sent to the event hub of each product, each product is responsible for storing the data and providing its unique security value on top of the data.
- The unified connectors scope doesn't include billing. Each individual product is responsible for how its users are charged
