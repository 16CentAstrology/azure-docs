New customers onboarding after July 1, 2025 with the relevant permissions are automatically onboarded to the Microsoft Defender portal and access Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal only. Existing customers, and new users without relevant permissions, can continue to use Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal. We recommend that you onboard to the Microsoft Defender portal for a unified security operations (SecOps) experience.  For more information, see [Automatic onboarding and redirects for new customers](../microsoft-sentinel-defender-portal.md#automatic-onboarding-and-redirects-for-new-customers).
