Starting in **July 2026**, all customers using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal will be redirected to the Defender portal and will use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal only. Starting in **July 2025**, many new users are also automatically [onboarded and redirected from the Azure portal to the Defender portal](../overview.md#changes-for-new-customers-starting-july-2025). If you're still using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal, we recommend that you start planning your transition to the Defender portal to ensure a smooth transition and take full advantage of the new unified security operations features offered by Microsoft Defender. For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal deprecation timeline](../overview.md#microsoft-sentinel-in-the-azure-portal-deprecation-timeline) and [It’s Time to Move: Retiring Microsoft Sentinel’s Azure portal for greater security](https://aka.ms/time-to-move-to-defender).
