## Sample Notebook Code Examples  
 
Below are some sample code snippets that demonstrate how to interact with lake data using Spark notebooks.  
 
### Access Lake Tier Entra ID Group Table  

The following code sample demonstrates how to access the Entra ID `Group` table in the Microsoft Sentinel data lake. It retrieves various fields such as displayName, groupTypes, mail, mailNickname, description, and tenantId. 

```python  
from sentinel_lake.providers import MicrosoftSentinelProvider
data_provider = MicrosoftSentinelProvider(spark)
 
table_name = "microsoft.entra.id.group"  
df = data_provider.read_table(table_name)  
df.select("displayName", "groupTypes", "mail", "mailNickname", "description", "tenantId").show(100, truncate=False)   
```  
The following screenshot shows a sample of the output of the code above, displaying the Entra ID group information in a dataframe format.

### Access Entra ID SignInLogs for a Specific User  
The following code sample demonstrates how to access the Entra ID `SignInLogs` table and filter the results for a specific user. It retrieves various fields such as UserDisplayName, UserPrincipalName, UserId, and more.

```python  
from sentinel_lake.providers import MicrosoftSentinelProvider
data_provider = MicrosoftSentinelProvider(spark)
 
table_name = "microsoft.entra.id.SignInLogs"  
df = data_provider.read_table(table_name)  
df.select("UserDisplayName", "UserPrincipalName", "UserId", "CorrelationId", "UserType", 
 "ResourceTenantId", "RiskLevel", "ResourceProvider", "IPAddress", "AppId", "AADTenantId")\
    .filter(df.UserPrincipalName == "benploni@contoso.com")\
    .show(100, truncate=False) 
```  
 
### Examine SignIn Locations  

The following code sample demonstrates how to extract and display sign-in locations from the Entra ID SignInLogs table. It uses the `from_json` function to parse the JSON structure of the `LocationDetails` field, allowing you to access specific location attributes such as city, state, and country or region.

```python  
from sentinel_lake.providers import MicrosoftSentinelProvider
from pyspark.sql.functions import from_json, col  
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType  
 
data_provider = MicrosoftSentinelProvider(spark)  
table_name = "microsoft.entra.id.signinlogs"  
df = data_provider.read_table(table_name)  
 
location_schema = StructType([  
  StructField("city", StringType(), True),  
  StructField("state", StringType(), True),  
  StructField("countryOrRegion", StringType(), True)  
])  
 
# Extract location details from JSON  
df = df.withColumn("LocationDetails", from_json(col("LocationDetails"), location_schema))  
df = df.select("UserPrincipalName", "CreatedDateTime", "IPAddress", 
 "LocationDetails.city", "LocationDetails.state", "LocationDetails.countryOrRegion")  
 
sign_in_locations_df = df.orderBy("CreatedDateTime", ascending=False)  
sign_in_locations_df.show(100, truncate=False) 
```
