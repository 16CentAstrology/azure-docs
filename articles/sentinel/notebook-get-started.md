# Get started with Jupyter notebooks and MSTICPy in Microsoft Sentinel

This article describes how to run the **Getting Started Guide For Microsoft Sentinel ML Notebooks** notebook, which sets up basic configurations for running Jupyter notebooks in Microsoft Sentinel and provides examples for running simple queries.

The **Getting Started Guide for Microsoft Sentinel ML Notebooks** notebook uses [MSTICPy](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a powerful Python library designed to enhance security investigations and threat hunting within Microsoft Sentinel notebooks. It provides built-in tools for data enrichment, visualization, anomaly detection, and automated queries, helping analysts streamline their workflow without extensive custom coding.

For more information, see [Use notebooks to power investigations](hunting.md#use-notebooks-to-power-investigations) and [Use Jupyter notebooks to hunt for security threats](notebooks.md).

## Install and run the Getting Started Guide notebook

This procedure describes how to launch your notebook with Microsoft Sentinel.

1.  For Microsoft Sentinel in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), under **Threat management**, select **Notebooks**. For Microsoft Sentinel in the [Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/), select **Microsoft Sentinel** > **Threat management** > **Notebooks**.

1. From the **Templates** tab, select **A Getting Started Guide For Microsoft Sentinel ML Notebooks** .
1. Select **Create from template**.
1. Edit the name and select the Azure Machine Learning workspace as appropriate.
1. Select **Save** to save it to your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

1. Select **Launch notebook** to run the notebook. The notebook contains a series of cells:

    - *Markdown* cells contain text and graphics with instructions for using the notebook
    - *Code* cells contain executable code that performs the notebook functions

1. At the top of the page, select your **Compute**, and then read and run the code cells in order using the instructions in the notebook. Skipping cells or running them out of order might cause errors later in the notebook.

    Depending on the compute you selected, it might take a few minutes to start. When the compute is ready, it'll show as **Ready** at the top of the tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/notebook-get-started/compute-ready.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a machine learning environment ready to run code cells.":::

    Depending on the function being performed, the code in the cell might run quickly, or it might take a few seconds to complete. When the cell is running, the play button changes to a loading spinner, and the status is displayed at the bottom of the cell, together with the elapsed time.

    Run the code cells in the **Introduction** section to learn the basics of running code in notebooks, and then run the code in the **Initializing the notebook and MSTICPy** section to set up your initial environment.
    
    When initializing the notebook, configuration warnings about missing settings are expected because you didn't configure anything yet.

## Create your configuration file

After the basic initialization, you're ready to create your configuration file with basic settings for working with MSTICPy.

Many Microsoft Sentinel notebooks connect to external services such as [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) (VT) to collect and enrich data. To connect to these services you need to set and store configuration details, such as authentication tokens. Having this data in your configuration file avoids you having to type in authentication tokens and workspace details each time you use a notebook.

MSTICPy uses a **msticpyconfig.yaml** for storing a wide range of configuration details.  By default, a **msticpyconfig.yaml** file is generated by the notebook initialization function. If you [cloned this notebook from the Microsoft Sentinel portal](#run-and-initialize-the-getting-started-guide-notebook), the configuration file is populated with Microsoft Sentinel workspace data. This data is read from a **config.json** file, created in the Azure Machine Learning workspace when you launch your notebook. For more information, see the [MSTICPy Package Configuration documentation](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/msticpyconfig.html).

The following sections describe how to add more configuration details to the **msticpyconfig.yaml** file.

If you run the *Getting Started Guide* notebook again, and already have a minimally configured **msticpyconfig.yaml** file, the `init_notebook` function doesn't overwrite or modify your existing file.

At any point in time, select the **-Help** drop-down menu in the MSTICPy configuration tool for more instructions and links to detailed documentation.

### Display the MSTICPy settings editor

1. Add a code cell to your notebook, and run the following code to import the `MpConfigEdit` tool and display a settings editor for your **msticpyconfig.yaml** file:

    ```python
    from msticpy.config import MpConfigEdit

    mpedit = MpConfigEdit( "msticpyconfig.yaml")
    mpedit.set_tab("AzureSentinel")
    display(mpedit)
    ```

    The automatically created **msticpyconfig.yaml** file is shown in the notebook in a series of editable tabs. In the **Microsoft Sentinel** tab, two entries are already populated with details of the Microsoft Sentinel workspace that the notebook was cloned from. One entry has the name of your workspace and the other is named **Default**.

    MSTICPy allows you to store configurations for multiple Microsoft Sentinel workspaces and switch between them. The **Default** entry allows you to authenticate to your "home" workspace by default, without having to name it explicitly. If you add another workspaces, you can configure any one of them to be the **Default** entry.

    In the Azure Machine Learning environment, the settings editor might take 10-20 seconds to appear.

1. Verify your current settings and select **Save Settings**.

### Add threat intelligence provider settings

This procedure describes how to store your [VirusTotal API key](#prerequisites) in the **msticpyconfig.yaml** file. You can opt to upload the API key to Azure Key Vault, but you must configure the Key Vault settings first. For more information, see [Configure Key Vault settings](#configure-key-vault-settings).

To add VirusTotal details in the MSTICPy settings editor, complete the following steps.

1. Add a new code cell and run the following:

   ```python
   mpedit.set_tab("TI Providers")
   mpedit
   ```

1. In the **TI Providers** tab, from the **Add prov** dropdown, select **VirusTotal** > **Add**.

1. Under **Auth Key**, select **Text** next to the **Storage** option.

1. In the **Value** field, paste your API key.

1. Select **Update**, and then select **Save Settings** at the bottom of the settings editor.

For more information about other supported threat intelligence providers, see [Threat intelligence providers](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_acquisition/TIProviders.html) in the MSTICPy documentation and [Threat intelligence integration in Microsoft Sentinel](threat-intelligence-integration.md).

### Add GeoIP provider settings

This procedure describes how to store a [MaxMind GeoLite2 account key](#prerequisites) in the **msticpyconfig.yaml** file, which allows your notebook to use geolocation lookup services for IP addresses.

To add GeoIP provider settings in the MSTICPy settings editor, complete the following steps.

1. Add a new code cell and run the following:

   ```python
   mpedit.set_tab("GeoIP Providers")
   mpedit
   ```

1. In the **GeoIP Providers** tab, from the **Add prov** dropdown, select **GeoIPLite** > **Add**.

1. In the **Value** field, enter your MaxMind account key.

1. If needed, update the default **~/.msticpy** folder for storing the downloaded GeoIP database.

    - On Windows, this folder is mapped to the **%USERPROFILE%/.msticpy**.
    - On Linux or macOS, this path is mapped to the **.msticpy** folder in your home folder.

For more information about other supported geolocation lookup services, see the [MSTICPy GeoIP Providers documentation](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_acquisition/GeoIPLookups.html).

### Configure Azure Cloud settings

If your organization doesn't use the Azure public cloud, you must specify this in your settings to successfully authenticate and use data from Microsoft Sentinel and Azure. For more information, see [Specify the Azure Cloud and default Azure Authentication methods](#specify-the-azure-cloud-and-azure-authentication-methods).

### Validate settings

1. On any tab in the MSTICPy settings editor, select **Validate settings**.

   Warning messages about missing configurations are expected, but you shouldn't have any for threat intelligence provider or GeoIP provider settings.

1. Depending on your environment, you might also need to [Configure Key Vault settings](#configure-key-vault-settings) or [Specify the Azure cloud](#specify-the-azure-cloud-and-azure-authentication-methods).

1. If you need to make any changes because of the validation, make those changes and then select **Save Settings**.

1. When you're done, select the **Close** button to hide the validation output.

- **Querying data from Microsoft Sentinel.** Use this section of the notebook to verify your Microsoft Sentinel settings in MSTICPy, load a QueryProvider to query data from Microsoft Sentinel, authenticate to Microsoft Sentinel, and test your connection.

   If you restart your Compute instance or switch to a different instance, you'll need to re-authenticate to Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see [Caching credentials with Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel-Notebooks/wiki/Caching-credentials-with-Azure-CLI).

- **Configure and test external data providers**. VirusTotal and Maxmind GeoLite2 are the external threat intelligence and geolocation data providers used as examples in this notebook. MSTICPy also supports other threat intelligence and geolocation providers. For more information, see:

    - [Threat intelligence providers](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_acquisition/TIProviders.html) in the MSTICPy documentation and [Threat intelligence integration in Microsoft Sentinel](threat-intelligence-integration.md)    
    - [MSTICPy GeoIP Providers documentation](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_acquisition/GeoIPLookups.html)

If your notebook doesn't seem to be working as described, restart the kernel and run the notebook from the beginning. For example, if any cell in the notebook takes longer than a minute to run, try restarting the kernel and re-running the notebook. The notebook includes instructions for the basic use of Jupyter notebooks, including restarting the Jupyter kernel.


## Test Key Vault (optional)

This section is relevant if you're using an Azure key vault to store your secrets, and describes how to test your connection to the vault from the notebook. If you didn't add a secret, you don't see any details. If you need to, add a test secret from the Azure Key Vault portal to the vault, and check that it shows in Microsoft Sentinel.

For example:

```Python
mpconfig = MpConfigFile()
mpconfig.refresh_mp_config()
mpconfig.show_kv_secrets()
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not leave the output displayed in your saved notebook. If there are real secrets in the output, use the notebook's **Clear output** command before saving the notebook.
>
> Also, delete cached copies of the notebook. For example, look in the **.ipynb_checkpoints** sub-folder of your notebook directory, and delete any copies of this notebook found. Saving the notebook with a cleared output should overwrite the checkpoint copy.
>

After you have your key vault configured, use the **Upload to KV** button in the Data Providers and TI Providers sections to move the selected setting to the vault. MSTICPy generates a default name for the secret based on the path of the setting, such as `TIProviders-VirusTotal-Args-AuthKey`.

If the value is successfully uploaded, the contents of the **Value** field in the settings editor is deleted and the underlying setting is replaced with a placeholder value. MSTICPy uses this value to indicate that it should automatically generate the Key Vault path when trying to retrieve the key.

If you already have the required secrets stored in a Key Vault, you can enter the secret name in the **Value** field. If the secret isn't stored in your default Vault (the values specified in the [Key Vault](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/SettingsEditor.html#key-vault) section), you can specify a path of **VaultName/SecretName**.

Fetching settings from a key vault in a different tenant isn't currently supported. For more information, see [Specifying secrets as Key Vault secrets](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/msticpyconfig.html#specifying-secrets-as-key-vault-secrets).

## Customize your queries (optional)

The **Getting Started Guide For Microsoft Sentinel ML Notebooks** notebook provides sample queries for you to use when learning about notebooks. You can customize the built-in queries by adding more query logic, or run complete queries using the `exec_query` function. For example, most built-in queries support the `add_query_items` parameter, which you can use to append filters or other operations to the queries.

1. Run the following code cell to add a data frame that summarizes the number of alerts by alert name:

    ```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    qry_prov.SecurityAlert.list_alerts(
       start=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(28),
        end=datetime.utcnow(),
        add_query_items="| summarize NumAlerts=count() by AlertName"
    )
    ```

1. Pass a full Kusto Query Language (KQL) query string to the query provider. The query runs against the connected workspace, and the data returns as a panda DataFrame. Run:

    ```python
    # Define your query
    test_query = """
    OfficeActivity
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
    | take 10
    """

    # Pass the query to your QueryProvider
    office_events_df = qry_prov.exec_query(test_query)
    display(office_events_df.head())

    ```

For more information, see:

- The [MSTICPy query reference](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_acquisition/DataQueries.html)
- [Running MSTICPy pre-defined queries](https://msticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_acquisition/DataProviders.html#running-an-pre-defined-query)

## Apply guidance to other notebooks

The steps in this article describe how to run the **Getting Started Guide for Microsoft Sentinel ML Notebooks** notebook in your Azure Machine Learning workspace via Microsoft Sentinel. You can also use this article as guidance for performing similar steps to run notebooks in other environments, including locally. 

Several Microsoft Sentinel notebooks don't use MSTICPy, such as the **Credential Scanner** notebooks, or the PowerShell and C# examples. Notebooks that don't use MSTICpy don't need the MSTICPy configuration described in this article.

Try out other Microsoft Sentinel notebooks, such as:

- **Configuring your Notebook Environment**
- **A Tour of Cybersec notebook features**
- **Machine Learning in Notebooks Examples**
- The **Entity Explorer** series, including variations for accounts, domains and URLs, IP addresses, and Linux or Windows hosts.
