# What is the Microsoft Sentinel Platform?

Microsoft Sentinel is an AI-first security platform designed to unify security data, scale dynamically, and enable agentic automation across heterogeneous environments. Anchored by the Microsoft Sentinel data lake, it delivers proactive, AI-enhanced defense capabilities that adapt to evolving threats.

## Core Components of the Microsoft Sentinel Platform

### Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake

- Cloud-native, fully managed data lake for security operations.
- Centralizes logs from Microsoft 365, Defender, Azure, Entra, Purview, Intune, AWS, GCP, and more.
- Decouples ingestion from analytics for cost optimization.
- Supports Kusto queries, scheduled jobs, and AI-powered notebooks via VS Code.
- Promotes insights to analytics tier without infrastructure setup.

### Data Connectors

- 350+ out-of-the-box connectors for first- and third-party solutions.
- Supports multi-cloud, SaaS, and on-premises environments.
- Built-in table management and tiered data placement.
- No-code and custom connector options.
- Normalizes data for unified views.

### Graph-Based Analytics

- Visualize incident scope with Blast Radius in Microsoft Defender.
- Map user-device relationships and privileged access paths.
- Trace sensitive data movement with Purview Insider Risk Management.
- Correlate audit logs and threat intelligence using Purview Data Risk Graph.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server

- Secure bridge between Security Copilot agents and Sentinel data.
- Enables natural language interaction with Sentinel data.
- Standardized tools and schemas for agent creation.
- Reduces AI hallucinations and improves reliability.
- Converts KQL/GQL queries into reusable MCP tools.
