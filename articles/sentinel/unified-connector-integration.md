# Connect to Microsoft Sentinel using a unified connector

[Unified connectors](./unified-connector.md) are the preferred way to create a connection. Even if you already have a connector to a product, we recommend removing it and installing a unified connector where possible.

## Prerequisites

### Microsoft Sentinel workspace

  1. In the Microsoft Security portal, navigate to **Settings** -> **Microsoft Sentinel**.
  1. Identify the Sentinel workspace currently connected.
  1. The Okta connector can be linked to any of your connected workspaces. Decide which workspace you want to connect to your Okta account.

### Azure access permissions

The user setting up the Okta connector must have the following roles:

- **Log Analytics Contributor** – Required to write data into the Log Analytics workspace and manage the Data Collection Rule (DCR).
- **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** – Required to modify connector settings in Sentinel.

Check user roles under the **Access control (IAM)** section of the **Log analytics workspace**.
If you need to assign these roles, allow 15 minutes for the changes to propagate before proceeding.

### Okta credentials

From your Okta account, you need the following information:

- **Domain name**: The URL of your Okta account without the `http://` prefix. For example, `yourcompany.okta.com`.
- **API token**: An Okta API token. To generate an API token, follow the instructions in [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/main/).

For information about integrating Okta with Defender for Identity, see [Integrate Okta with Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/okta-integration).

## Configure an Okta connector to a Sentinel workspace

To create an Okta instance in Microsoft Sentinel using the Okta unified connector, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Data connectors Gallery [directly](https://security.microsoft.com/sentinel/unified-connector), or navigate to it via **System** -> **Data management** -> **Data connectors**.

   For more information about the Data connectors Gallery, see [Data connectors Gallery](./unified-connector.md#data-connectors-gallery).

1. Select the **Okta Single Sign-On** connector.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/unified-connector-integration/okta-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Okta connector in the Connectors Gallery.":::

1. Select a connector. A side panel opens with more information about the connector, including prerequisites.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/unified-connector-integration/okta-connector-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Okta connector configuration page.":::

1. Select **Connect a connector** to open the connector configuration wizard.
1. In the **Name and connection details** section, provide the following information:
   - **Connector name**: A descriptive user friendly name for the connector.
   - **Domain name**: The Okta domain, such as `yourcompany.okta.com`.
   - **API key**: Paste the [API key](#okta-credentials). Don't include the *Authorization* prefix, only the token value.
   Select **Next**.

1. In the **Select products** section, check the products you want to connect to. Check *SIEM* to enable the connector for Microsoft Sentinel.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/unified-connector-integration/select-products.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the select products section of the connector wizard.":::

1. Configure the product details for each product you selected:

   - Select the required workspace, whose permissions you validated [earlier](#azure-access-permissions).
   - Select the table manager.

1. Select **Connect**. The **Connect** button is only active when all the required fields are valid.

The connection process can take up to two minutes. If an error occurs, follow the provided error message for troubleshooting.

The initial state of the connector is *Pending* until the initial data is received successfully. It can take up to 30 minutes to receive data. If data isn't successfully received, the connector moves to an *Error* state.

Connectors that are successfully connected, appear in the **My Connectors tab**, and Okta system logs are ingested into your **Log Analytics workspace**.

## Manage your connector

Existing connectors appear in the **My Connectors tab**.

### Edit a connector

To edit a connector, select it and then select **Manage** from the connector side panel.

### Delete a connector

You can delete a connector in one of two ways:

- Select it and then select **Delete** from the connector side panel.
- Check the connector in the **My Connectors** tab and then select **Delete** from above the connector list.

## Verify data ingestion in Log analytics

To verify that the Okta connector is successfully ingesting data into your Log Analytics workspace, first ensure that your Okta account is generating system logs. If no logs are generated, manually generate some test logs.

- From the Microsoft Security portal: navigate to **Investigation & response** > **Hunting** > **Advanced hunting**. Once Okta logs are ingested into your workspace, you should find an *OktaSystemLogs* table under the *Microsoft Sentinel* tab
- From Azure portal, navigate to your selected **Log Analytics Workspace** > **Logs** > **OktaSystemLogs**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - It can take up to 30 minutes from when you create the the connector instance for the *OktaSystemLogs* table to appear, containing your Okta system logs.
> - The connector will only ingest system logs from one hour before the instance was created.

## Considerations and limitations

- Unified connectors aren't visible in the Content hub. To see the unified connectors, go to the [Data connectors Gallery](https://security.microsoft.com/sentinel/unified-connector).
