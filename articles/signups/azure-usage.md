# Track your Azure startup credit usage

You can manage your Azure subscription and startup credits directly in the Azure portal. Your billing profile is used to manage invoices and payment methods. Invoices are generated monthly, and any available credits are automatically applied to your total charges.

You can check your startup credit balance and expiration date from the Azure portal homepage or by [using Cost Management + Billing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/mca-check-azure-credits-balance?tabs=portal).

## Transition to pay-as-you-go

Once your startup credits are exhausted or expire, your Azure Sponsorship subscription will automatically convert to a [pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/) subscription. You'll only pay for what you use while continuing to access [65+ free services](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=payg#free-services). There's no upfront commitment, and you can [cancel your subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription) at any time.

## Billing and payments

After your subscription converts to pay-as-you-go, the credit card used to activate your startup credits will be automatically [charged each billing period](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/review-individual-bill) for the previous month's usage.

You can [change the credit card on file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/change-credit-card) or request to [pay by wire transfer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/pay-by-invoice). To ensure a smooth transition between your sponsorship subscription and paid subscription, verify the credit card on your billing profile is up to date before your credits expire.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why am I being charged when I have startup credits?

Some exclusions apply and usage may not be covered by your startup credits. To check your charges, open a support request via the Azure Portal. Select 'Help+Support' to submit a ticket.

### How can I estimate costs of Azure services?

Use the [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate monthly costs. While your startup credits are active, your Azure usage will be 100% off standard published [pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) rates for the duration of your offer.

### How can I monitor my Azure usage and spending?

You can track and monitor your costs using [budgets](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets), [cost alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-alerts-monitor-usage-spending), and [cost analysis](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis).
