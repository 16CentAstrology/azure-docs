## Frequently asked questions

### How do I activate my $200 startup credit offer?

From the Azure portal, eligible startups can sign up for Azure to redeem $200 USD in Azure credits. After signing up with a personal Microsoft account (MSA), your $200 startup credit offer will be automatically applied to your Azure Sponsorship subscription. You can start using your credits immediately for eligible Azure services.

### Why do I need a credit card to redeem my startup credit offer?

Your credit card is required for:

- Identity verification.
- Paying for services not covered by your startup credits. See [which Azure services](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/) are included.
- A seamless transition to pay-as-you-go when your startup credits expire.

### How long do I have to use my startup credit offer?

You have 60 days after creating your Azure Sponsorship subscription to use your startup credits. Unused credits will expire after 60 days.

### What happens when my $200 startup credit runs out or expires?

Your Azure Sponsorship subscription will automatically convert to pay-as-you-go once your $200 startup credit is fully used or 60 days have passed, whichever comes first. You'll only pay for what you use while continuning to access [65+ free services](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=payg#free-services). There's no upfront commitment, and you can [cancel your subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription) at any time.

### How can I get more Azure credits?

Startups affiliated with select investors are invited to join Microsoft for Startups to receive Azure credits, dedicated support, and discounted first- and third-party products and services. These investors have been given a code to share with startups that they work with. Investors can share this code with current startups in their cohort / programs as well as alumni.
