# Two ways to build Your startup with Microsoft

Microsoft supports startups at different stages of their journey in two distinct ways:

- Azure startup credit offer - A fixed Azure credit offer for eligible startups and individual founders looking to explore Azure services and start building.
- Microsoft for Startups - An invite-only program that partners with select investors to offer additional benefits to startups in their cohort or community.

These two paths are designed to make accessing Azure credits and resources easier, no matter how you get started.

## Frequently asked questions

### Who qualifies for the Azure startup credit offer?

To qualify for the $200 startup credit offer, you must meet the following criteria:

- You must be a new customer with no prior Azure account.
- You must sign up or sign in using a valid personal Microsoft account (MSA).
- You must be in a country/region where this Azure offer is available.

### How do I apply for Microsoft for Startups?

Microsoft for Startups accepts new startups into the program through a select group of investor partners. These investors have been given a code to share with startups that they work with. Investors can share this code with current startups in their cohorts / programs as well as alumni. To learn more, [refer to this Microsoft Learn article](/microsoft-for-startups/application).

### Can I receive the startup credit offer and join Microsoft for Startups?

Yes! Founders that begin with the startup credit offer have an opportunity to join Microsoft for Startups if they receive funding from an affiliated investor. Startups will enter their investor's unique referral code on the Microsoft for Startups website to become eligible for the program.

If you have already redeemed Azure credits through Microsoft for Startups, you are not eligible for the startup credit offer.
