# Data residency and privacy in Azure SRE Agent (preview)

The following data residency and privacy policies are in effect for Azure SRE Agent while in preview.

By using an SRE Agent, you consent to the product-specific [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Data residency

- All content and conversation history with the SRE Agent is transferred to and stored in the Sweden Central region. Data includes prompts, responses, and resource analysis.  

- All data is transferred to Sweden Central, regardless of the Azure region of origin.

- You don't have the option to keep data processed by the agent in an Azure region outside Sweden Central.

- You can't specify data residency requirements or opt out of cross-border transfers during the preview.

## Privacy

- Your data isn't used to train AI models. Your data is only accessible to engineers for service improvement and debugging, but not for model training.

- Data collected includes End User Identifiable Information (EUII) and Organization Identifiable Information (OII)

- Data is isolated using tenant and Azure subscription boundaries.
