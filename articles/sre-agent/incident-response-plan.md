# Incident response plans in Azure SRE Agent

An Azure SRE Agent custom incident response plan allows you to define how incidents are detected, reviewed, and mitigated within your environment. When you define custom plans, you tailor the agent’s response to incidents, set autonomy levels, and provide custom instructions for incident management. You can choose between either semi-autonomous and fully autonomous operations, depending on your needs.

## How incident response works



## Default settings

## Ways to customize the plan

You have the option to create custom instructions through filters, setting autonomy level, and customizing the prompt context for how incidents are processed.

### Filter incidents

The following filters are available for you to customize incident plan instructions.

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| Incident type | Select the type of incidents you want your plan to process. Options include default, major, and security incidents.  |
| Impacted service | Select the service you want your plan to process. Options include all impacted services, or you can select a service by name. |
| Priority | Select the incident priority level you want your plan to process. Options include all priorities or P1 - P5. |
| Title contains | Provide a text string to match against incident title values. |

### Set autonomy level

Inside an incident response plan, you can choose the autonomy level for the agent.

| Autonomy level | Description | Is default |
|---|---|---|
| Review | In this semi-autonomous mode, the agent diagnoses incidents then mitigates or modifies resources only after the proposed actions are reviewed and approved by you. | Yes |
| Autonomous | In this fully autonomous mode, the agent analyzes incidents and independently performs mitigation or resource modifications.<br><br>**Note** : If the agent doesn't have the required permissions to take action, it prompts you to grant temporary access to elevated permissions. | No |

## Create a new handler

1. Open your SRE Agent in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Incident management**.

1. On the *Incident platform* window, select the platform you want to manage your incident.

1. Select **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Once connected, the top tab strip now includes an *Incident management* tab.

1. Select the **Incident management** tab.

1. Select **New incident handler** to open the handler configuration window.

1. To configure your handler, set the following values:

    | Property | Value | Note |
    |---|---|---|
    | Incident handler  name | Enter a unique name for your handler. | |
    | Incident type | Select the types of incidents you want this handler to manage. | If you're using Azure Monitor, the only option available is *All incident types*.  |
    | Impacted service | Select the services you want to monitor. | If you're using Azure Monitor, the only available option is *All impacted services*. |
    | Priority | Select the priority of incidents you want to manage. | If you're using Azure Monitor, the only available option is *All priorities*. |
    | Title contains | Enter a string that filters incident titles. | |

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you'd like more control over defining the incident types, services impacted, and priorities, consider using PagerDuty or ServiceNow as your incident management platform.

1. Under *Autonomy level*, select either *Review* or *Autonomous*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Begin by setting your agent autonomy level to *Review*. Once you evaluate how the agent deals with incidents in different contexts, and your confidence level in the agent behavior is satisfactory, then you can change the level to *Autonomous*.

1. To add custom instructions, select the checkbox next to *Add custom instructions*.

    When you add custom instructions, you give the agent an opportunity to learn from existing incidents. You also can't provide an extra set of prompts that guide the agent with custom instructions in dealing with incidents.

1. Select **Next**.

1. On the *Choose incidents* window, select up to five incidents for the agent to learn from.

1. In the *Add custom instructions* section, enter prompts to guide the agent’s review and mitigation process.

    For more information, see the [example prompts](#example-custom-instruction-prompts) section.

1. Select **Generate** to generate the handler's execution plan.

1. Review the generated plan in the custom instructions box.

1. Under the *Tools* section, review the list of tools the agent uses.

    You can remove or add tools as needed.

1. Select **Save** to finalize and save your incident handler.
