# Azure SRE Agent overview (preview)

Azure SRE Agent is an AI-powered service combining artificial intelligence with Azure and site reliability engineering best practices to help you monitor, manage, and maintain your Azure resources. The agent proactively identifies issues, provides actionable insights, and performs remediation tasks to ensure maximum uptime for your critical cloud services.

The agent acts as a virtual team member, the agent continuously monitors your resources, analyzes performance data, and responds to incidents in real-time. Whether you're troubleshooting application issues, deploying new services, or maintaining existing infrastructure, Azure SRE Agent reduces operational toil and lets you focus on higher value work.

## Key features

Azure SRE Agent is made up from the following key features:

* **Specialized AI-enabled tooling**: SRE Agent offers fine-tuned tools that help you manage and maintain Azure services according to architectural and security best practices. The agent handles manual and mundane tasks while maintaining a continuous context of your Azure services and environments. This environmental awareness enables the agent to quickly identify root causes and troubleshoot issues for you.

* **Conversational chat interface**: By responding to your prompts, you can use the agent to troubleshoot and resolve application issues, deploy Azure services, and delegate work to autonomous agents all via a chat window.

* **Incident management**: You can configure the agent to be the first to respond to incidents in your environment. Paired with [Azure Monitor Alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview), [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/), or [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/), you can define custom resolution workflows to quickly resolve issues. Depending on your configuration, the agent can fix problems upon your approval, or work autonomously.

* **Continuous, proactive monitoring**: The agent continuously evaluates activity in your environments to monitor active resources. The agent maintains a knowledge graph of your Azure infrastructure maintaining relationships between resources and dependencies.

* **Source code integration**: When you connect your source code to an Azure resource through SRE Agent, the agent is able to help pin-point root causes in your code base. If you connect a resource to a GitHub repository, the agent can delegate fixes to GitHub Copilot.

## How do I use Azure SRE Agent?

Azure SRE Agent serves as a virtual Site Reliability Engineer, helping you maintain and optimize your Azure resources. Here's how you can use the agent on a daily basis:

1. **Incident response**: When alerts trigger from your monitoring systems, interact with the agent through the chat interface to quickly diagnose issues. The agent can analyze the problem, suggest mitigations, and with your approval, implement fixes automatically.

1. **Proactive maintenance**: Use the agent to identify optimization opportunities in your environment. Ask questions like "Which of my apps need configuration improvements?" or "Are there any resources not following security best practices?"

1. **Daily briefings**: Start your day by reviewing the daily resource report automatically generated by the agent. This report provides a snapshot of your environment's health, highlighting any incidents that occurred overnight and their current status.

1. **Resource management**: Delegate routine tasks like scaling resources, reviewing configurations, or checking on service health by asking the agent through the chat interface.

1. **Resource visualization**: When you need to understand relationships between resources or troubleshoot dependencies, ask the agent to visualize your infrastructure and explain connections between services. Further, you can review the resource visualization the agent maintains in the Azure portal.
