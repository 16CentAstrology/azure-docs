# Azure SRE Agent overview (preview)

**Transform reactive operations into proactive reliability for apps on Azure**

Azure SRE Agent is an AI-powered reliability assistant that helps you **prevent, diagnose, and resolve production issues faster with less toil**.  
Ask questions in natural language, get explainable RCAs, and orchestrate incident workflows with **human-in-the-loop approvals** or **autonomous execution within scoped guardrails**.

## What You Can Do with SRE Agent

| üó®Ô∏è **Ask & Understand** | ‚öôÔ∏è **Automate Incidents** | üõ°Ô∏è **Stay Proactive** |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Ask plain-language questions about Azure resources, incidents, and health. | Diagnose, mitigate, and resolve incidents across Azure Monitor and integrated tools like ServiceNow‚Äîautomatically or with approvals. | Agent sends daily summaries of environment health, flags spikes in CPU/memory usage, and identifies resources not following security best practices. |
| **Examples:**<br>‚Ä¢ What changed in *payments-prod* in last 24h?<br>‚Ä¢ Which resources are unhealthy?<br>‚Ä¢ What alerts are active now? | **Examples:**<br>‚Ä¢ Incidents from ServiceNow<br>‚Ä¢ 500 error alerts from Azure Monitor | **Examples:**<br>‚Ä¢ Daily health summary for *prod-web*<br>‚Ä¢ CPU spike detection<br>‚Ä¢ Security compliance violations |
