# Create a storage task by using .NET

This quickstart describes how to create a storage task by using .NET.

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Subheading

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group. The resource group and all the resources in the
resource group are deleted. Use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name <resource-group-name>
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name <resource-group-name>
```

---

Replace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of your resource group.
