# Azure Storage Discovery concepts

Deploying Azure Storage Discovery workspace in one of your Azure subscriptions is the first step in starting aggregation of storage account metrics. This article discusses the important decisions and best practices for a Storage Discovery deployment.

## Select a subscription and region for Azure Storage Discovery workspace deployment

Azure Storage Discovery workspace can be deployed in a subscription of your choice and in one of the supported regions as listed in [Regional coverage of Azure Storage Discovery](regionalCoverage.md).

Once created, a Discovery workspace can aggregate metrics from storage accounts within its "Scope", regardless of whether those accounts reside in different regions. The list of regions from which metrics are aggregated is also provided in the [Regional coverage of Azure Storage Discovery](regionalCoverage.md).

## Permissions

To deploy a Discovery Workspace, user must have following access:

| Scenario | Minimal RBAC role assignments needed |
|---|---| 
| To deploy Discovery workspace | Contributor access on the subscription | 
| To include the subscription or resource groups in a Discovery workspace as part of *workspaceRoots* | Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read access on the subscription or resource group | 
| To view Discovery reports | Reader access on the Discovery workspace |
