# Storage redundancy change FAQs

The need to change your storage account's redundancy options can be driven by many different factors. The decision to change redundancy options is a dynamic process that involves carefully weighing the organization's needs for data availability, disaster recovery, performance, and cost against the risks and benefits of various redundancy options. Regular assessment and adjustment are crucial to ensuring an optimal and resilient data storage strategy. This article contains answers to frequently asked questions about Azure Storage redundancy.

## What is the billing impact of the SKU conversion process? 

When you add or remove zonal redundancy to a storage account (LRS <-> ZRS, GRS <-> GZRS or RA-GRS <-> RA-GZRS) there's no initial cost for making the conversion. Once the SKU is successfully converted for the account, the ongoing data storage and transaction cost might be higher due to the increased replication. For example, when converting an account from LRS to ZRS completing the conversion is free of cost but ZRS has a higher data storage and data transaction cost than LRS. 

For details on pricing, see the [Azure Storage Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) article.

When you add geo-redundancy (LRS -> GRS / RA-GRS or ZRS -> GZRS / RA-> GZRS), the conversion incurs a [geo-replication data transfer charge](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) at the time of the change because your entire storage account is being replicated to the secondary region. All subsequent writes to the primary region also incur geo-replication data transfer charges to replicate the write to the secondary region.

When you remove geo-redundancy (GRS -> LRS or ZRS -> GZRS), there are no costs for making this change.

It's important to note when you remove read access from your storage account (RA-GRS -> GRS or RA-GZRS -> GZRS), that account is billed as RA-GRS or RA-GZRS for 30 days beyond the date on which it was converted.

## How long does the SKU conversion process take? 

**Shall we explicitly callout here that creating a support ticket won't help?  Also clarify that ZRS and GRS migration process are different?**

A zonal redundancy conversion (LRS <-> ZRS, GRS <-> GZRS, RA-GRS <-> RA-GZRS) typically starts within a few days after the request is validated. However, it might take up to weeks depending on current resource demands in the region, account size, and other factors. 

It is not possible to speed up this process by submitting a support request. The conversion progress will change to 'In progress' when data movement begins.

There's currently no SLA for completion of a SKU conversion. If you need more control over when a conversion begins and finishes, consider a Manual migration. Manual migrations utilize a feature or tool such as AzCopy to migrate the data of your current storage account to another storage account with the desired redundancy.

A geo redundancy conversion (LRS <-> GRS or ZRS <-> GZRS) currently has no SLA for completion. It is not possible to speed up this process by submitting a support request. The timeframe it takes to complete these conversions can vary depending on various factors, including:

- The number and size of the objects in the storage account.
- The available resources for background replication, such as CPU, memory, disk, and WAN capacity.

## Why is my SKU conversion process taking so long? 

**Also clarify that ZRS and GRS migration process are different?**

There's currently no SLA for completion of a  SKU conversion. It is not possible to speed up this process by submitting a support request. The conversion progress will change to 'In progress' when data movement begins.

If you need more control over when a conversion begins and finishes, consider a Manual migration. Manual migrations utilize a feature or tool such as AzCopy to migrate the data of your current storage account to another storage account with the desired redundancy. The SKU conversion process typically completes within a few days but can take up to a few weeks depending on the current resource demands in the region, account size along with various other factors.

## What is the performance and availability impact of a SKU conversion? Is there any application downtime expected? Is there any data loss expected?

During a SKU conversion, you can access data in your storage account with no loss of durability or availability. The Azure Storage SLA is maintained during the migration process and no data is lost during a conversion. Service endpoints, access keys, shared access signatures, and other account options remain unchanged after the migration.

## How do I convert my account from LRS to GZRS?

A direct conversion form LRS to GZRS isn't supported today and this conversion requires a two-step process. You have the option of completing this conversion two ways: (1) LRS to ZRS followed by ZRS to GZRS or (2) LRS to GRS followed by GRS to GZRS. 
        
It's important to note if you decide to do LRS -> ZRS then ZRS -> GZRS you must wait at least 72 hours before changing the redundancy setting of the storage account after the LRS -> ZRS conversion. The temporary hold allows background processes to complete before making another change, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the account.

## How do I convert my account from GRS to ZRS?

A direct conversion from GRS to ZRS isn't supported today and this conversion requires a two-step process. You have the option of completing this conversion two ways: 

- GRS to GZRS, followed by GZRS to ZRS.
- GRS to LRS, followed by LRS to ZRS.

It's important to note if you decide to do GRS -> GZRS then GZRS -> ZRS you must wait at least 72 hours before changing the redundancy setting of the storage account after the GRS -> GZRS conversion. The temporary hold allows background processes to complete before making another change, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the account. If you decide to do GRS to LRS then LRS to ZRS your storage account is temporarily left in a lower redundancy option (LRS) which means you have less durability and availability.

The temporary hold allows background processes to complete before making another change, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the account. When you complete the ZRS to LRS conversion, your storage account is also temporarily in a lower redundancy option (LRS). This state provides your data with less durability and availability.

## What are the conflicting features or scenarios for SKU conversions?

### Zonal Conversions (LRS <-> ZRS, GRS <-> GZRS, and RA-GRS <-> RA-GZRS)

- Object Replication: User can delete their object replication policies and retry. (WILL BE UNBLOCKED SOON)
- NFSv3: User can't unconfigure NFSv3 once enabled so if they really want ZRS they have to do a manual migration. For example, use AzCopy
- Point in time restore (PITR): User can disable PITR and retry (WILL BE UNBLOCKED SOON)
- Archive data: User can rehydrate their data to cold, cool, or hot then retry or they can delete the archived data.
- NFSv4 accounts with public endpoints: User can disable access to the storage accountâ€™s public endpoints (Change how a storage account is replicated - Azure Storage | Microsoft Learn)
- Routing choice == Internet Routing: User can set their routing preference to Microsoft network routing (Configure network routing preference - Azure Storage | Microsoft Learn)
- Accounts with boot diagnostics enabled (this is only blocked for LRS -> ZRS, GRS -> GZRS and RA-GRS -> RA-GZRS): User can disable boot diagnostics on their account (Boot diagnostics for VMs in Azure - Virtual Machines | Microsoft Learn). Users canâ€™t re-enable once the conversion is completed because boot diagnostics isn't supported for ZRS. 
- Requested current and target SKU change is supported (example: GRS -> ZRS is currently not supported). If the user attempts to change their GRS account to ZRS, they run into a failure.
- Their region supports the SKU they're attempting to convert to. Example: Mexico Central doesn't support GZRS so if a user attempts to convert their account from GRS to GZRS it fails.
- There's a conflicting migration currently ongoing on their account. Example: attempting to do LRS -> ZRS while LRS -> GRS is already in progress. User has to wait until the original migration completes before submitting a new conversion request.
- Account is failed over: User can failback their account to the original primary region then resubmit the request.


### Geo Conversions (LRS <-> GRS, ZRS <-> GZRS)

- Archive data (If accounts have archive data the data needs to be rehydrated before the LRS -> GRS request can be submitted). This is a check performed by SRP and users receive an error message almost instantly.
- Ensure your region supports your desired SKU (ex: there are 3+0 regions that support ZRS but don't support GZRS)
