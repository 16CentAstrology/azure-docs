# How to Estimate the Cost of Azure Files

How to estimate the cost of Azure Files 
In this article, we will demonstrate how to estimate the cost between Provisioned v1 and Provisioned v2 SSD billing model. We will provide a detailed breakdown of three scenarios used in the Provisioned v2 SSD release blog post. 
Important 
These prices are meant only as examples and should not be used to calculate your costs. For official prices, see the Azure File Storage pricing. For more information about how to choose the correct billing model, see Understand the billing model for Azure Files. We also encourage you to use Azure File Pricing calculator to perform the actual calculations. 
For the following examples, we will be using pricing based on East US and LRS redundancy support. Provisioned v1 billing model is billed hourly in a monthly rate, where provisioned storage will be $0.16 per GiB. Provisioned v2 will be billed hourly in a hourly rate, provisioned storage will be $0.000137 per GiB per hour, Provisioned IOPS at $0.000037 per IOPS per hour, and provisioned throughput at $0.000054 per MiB per sec per hour. For the easy of calculations, we will assume all month have 730 hours. If you want to calculate the exact price, replace the hours with 24 × days in the specific month. 
Comparison using defaults IOPS and throughputs: 
For this scenario, we are using the recommended IOPS and throughput based on our capacity request:
•	10,240 GiB in capacity 
•	13,240 IOPS 
•	1,125 MiB/sec throughput  
 
 	Provisioned v1 SSD 	Provisioned v2 SSD 
Cost components 	10,240 used GiB × $0.16/GiB = $1,638.40 	Provisioned storage: 10,240 GiB × $0.000137 /GiB × 730hr = $1024.10
 	 	Provisioned IOPS: (13,240 – 3,000) × $0.000037/IOPS × 730hr = $276.58
 	 	Provisioned throughput: (1,125 – 100) × $0.000054/MiB/sec × 730hr = $40.41
Total cost 	$1,638.40/month 	$1,341.09/month 
 
100 – ($1,341.09 / $1,638.40 × 100) = 18.15% 
With the exact same provisioning size, IOPS, and throughput, using the Pv2 billing model saves around 18% monthly on the total cost of ownership for the file share.
Comparison of relational database workload
Let us assume we are making a price comparison in the following relational database workload deployment. 
•	4,096 GiB in capacity 
•	20,000 IOPS 
•	1,536 MiB /sec throughput  
If we are using the provisioned v1 billing model, we need to reverse calculate on the IOPS and throughput to see how much we need to provision the capacity to meet exactly the requirement mentioned above. 
•	To meet IOPS requirements, we will need 20,000-3,000=17,000 GiB
•	To meet throughput requirements, we will need (1536-100)/ (0.04+0.06) = 14,360 GiB
Learn more about the equation at Understand the billing model for Azure Files. 
To meet both requirements, in Provisioned v1, we need to provision 17,000 GiB to meet all three criteria. 
 
 	Provisioned v1 SSD 	Provisioned v2 SSD 
Cost components 	17,000 used GiB × $0.16/GiB = $2720.00	Provisioned storage: 4,096 GiB × $0.000137 /GiB × 730hr = $409.64
 	 	Provisioned IOPS: (20,000 – 3,000) × $0.000037/IOPS × 730hr = $ 459.17
 	 	Provisioned throughput: (1,536 – 100) × $0.000054/MiB/sec × 730hr = $56.61
Total cost 	$2720.00/month 	$925.42 /month 
100 – ($925.42 / $2720.00 × 100) = 65.98% 
For this workload experience, Provisioned v2 SSD shines with a 66% discount compared to the provisioned v1 billing model. 
Comparison of a hot archive for multimedia workload
Let us assume we are making price comparison in the following hot archive for multimedia workload deployment. 
•	102,400 GiB in capacity 
•	15,000 IOPS 
•	2048 MiB /sec throughput  
For this scenario, if we are using the provisioned v1 billing model, we must follow the provisioned storage requirements and over-provision our IOPS and throughput. Here are the reverse calculations on the IOPS and throughput to see how much we are over-provisioned. 
IOPS limit will be 102,400 + 3,000 = 105,400 IOPS
Throughput limit will be 102,400*0.1+100=10,340 MiB / sec 
 
 	Provisioned v1 SSD 	Provisioned v2 SSD 
Cost components 	102,400 used GiB × $0.16/GiB = $16,384.00	Provisioned storage: 102,400 GiB × $0.000137 /GiB × 730hr = $10241.02
 	 	Provisioned IOPS: (15,000 – 3,000) × $0.000037/IOPS × 730hr = $ 324.12
 	 	Provisioned throughput: (2,048 – 100) × $0.000054/MiB/sec × 730hr = $76.79
Total cost 	$16,384.00/month 	$10641.93/month 
100 – ($10641.93/ $16384.00 × 100) = 35.05% 
For this workload experience, Provisioned v2 SSD benefit with a 35.06% discount compared to the provisioned v1 billing model.
