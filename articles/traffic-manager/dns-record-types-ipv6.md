# DNS record types and IPv6 support in Azure Traffic Manager

## DNS record types

Azure Traffic Manager uses DNS to direct incoming client requests to the best service endpoint based on the selected routing method. Traffic Manager supports three types of DNS records: AAAA, A, and CNAME records, enabling you to route traffic across both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. This flexibility is essential for modern internet applications where dual-stack environments are increasingly common.

## AAAA records for IPv6 support

AAAA records map domain names to IPv6 addresses. Azure Traffic Manager supports IPv6 records, enabling traffic routing to services accessible over IPv6 addresses. As the internet transitions towards IPv6, ATM is equipped to handle this newer protocol, ensuring seamless reachability for services.

ATM now includes these IPv6 capabilities:

- **IPv6 Maps in DNS Nameservers**: Lets you efficiently manage and resolve IPv6 addresses. This includes IPv6 address space in its internal DNS maps, letting global IPv6 clients get low-latency resolution.

- **IPv6 Client Subnet (ECS) Support**: ECS (EDNS Client Subnet) for IPv6 lets ATM make geographically accurate routing decisions based on part of the clientâ€™s IPv6 address. This helps shape traffic and minimize latency for end users.

- **IPv6 Subnet Overrides**: Lets you control traffic routing based on the source IP address of DNS queries, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

These enhancements give full support for IPv6 AAAA record types and provide robust traffic management in IPv6 environments.

## A records for IPv4 addresses

A records map domain names to IPv4 addresses. IPv4 is the backbone of the internet and is still widely used, even as IPv6 adoption grows. Azure Traffic Manager supports IPv4 records, so your existing services and infrastructure stay compatible.

## CNAME records for domain aliasing

CNAME (canonical name) records map an alias name to a trafficmanager.net domain name. Azure Traffic Manager supports CNAME records as endpoints, so you can route traffic to a domain name instead of a specific IP address.

CNAME records simplify DNS configuration management. You can handle changes to IP addresses at the authoritative DNS level without changing settings in Azure Traffic Manager, so DNS management is more efficient and scalable.

For example, a domain like www.contoso.com can point to contoso.trafficmanager.net. You can manage changes to backend service IP addresses centrally without updating the user-facing domain.

## Dual-stack support in Traffic Manager

Azure Traffic Manager is dual stack at the DNS level, so it responds to both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) DNS queries. This dual stack capability is available only when you use CNAME-based endpoints, because A and AAAA records respond only to their respective query types. Clients connect over the protocol their network or device prefers, based on standard DNS resolution behavior.

For most production scenarios, use DNS-based (CNAME) endpoints. This approach gives you flexibility, simplifies management, and ensures compatibility with both IPv4 and IPv6 clients.

> [!NOTE]
> Traffic Manager doesn't support setting up separate endpoints within the same profile that use different DNS record types (like one A and one AAAA). This setup ensures that DNS responses from Traffic Manager match the record type the client requests.
