# Microsoft Purview forensic evidence for Azure Virtual Desktop

[Forensic evidence](/purview/insider-risk-management-forensic-evidence) is an opt-in add-on feature in Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management that gives security teams visual insights into potential insider data security incidents. Forensic evidence includes customizable event triggers and built-in user privacy protection controls, enabling security teams to better investigate, understand and respond to potential insider data risks like unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive data. 

You set the right policies for your organization, including what risky events are the highest priority for capturing forensic evidence, what data is most sensitive, and whether users are notified when forensic capturing is activated. 
	
When using forensic evidence for Azure Virtual Desktop, you can set policies to trigger recordings of application and desktop sessions automatically. Forensic evidence capturing is off by default and policy creation requires dual authorization.
