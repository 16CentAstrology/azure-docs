# Create a Site-to-Site High Bandwidth tunnels in the Azure portal
The Azure VPN Gateway High Bandwidth tunnels feature, a part of the Advanced Connectivity set of features, introduces significant improvements in tunnel throughput, enabling high-performance IPsec connections between the on-premises network and the Azure VNet. These High Bandwidth tunnels are established between a VPN device on-premises and the Azure VPN Gateway deployed in the Azure VNet, transiting through an ExpressRoute private peering. Utilizing private IP address networks on-premises, these tunnels create a secure overlay network between the on-premises infrastructure and the Azure VNet.

The High Bandwidth tunnels meet customer security compliance requirements by providing end-to-end encryption, effectively overcoming encryption bottlenecks. It allows for the establishment of four tunnels between the Azure VPN Gateway and the on-premises VPN device. The High Bandwidth tunnels allow for the creation of two Connections with two IPsec tunnels for each Connection. Each IPsec tunnel can deliver a throughput of 5 Gbps, achieving a total encrypted aggregate throughput of 20 Gbps. The network diagram clarifies the configuration:

![1]

## Prerequisites
The VPN High Bandwidth tunnels require the presence of FastPath in an ExpressRoute Connection. Currently FastPath is supported only in ExpressRoute Direct Port Pair. Therefore, the ExpressRoute circuit required to be deployed on ExpressRoute Direct port pair for the correct setting of the solution.

This article assumes the presence in the Azure subscription of an ExpressRoute circuit configured on Direct port pair with private peering, along with a Virtual Network (VNet). The Azure VNet is created with address space 10.1.0.0./16 and Gateway subnet 10.1.0.0/26

The full list of required objects are:
 - ExpressRoute Direct Port
 - ExpressRoute Circuit
 - ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway
 - Connection between the ExpressRoute circuit and the virtual network gateway WITH FastPath enabled.
 - VPN Gateway of sku type VpnGw5AZ with Advanced Connectivity enabled
 - VPN Local Network Gateway
 - User Defined Route (UDR) to push ER traffic to the VPN Gateway

## <a name="VNetGateway"></a>Create an ExpressRoute Gateway 
The ExpressRoute Gateway can be only deployed in the GatewaySubnet. The ExpressRoute Gateway needs to be deployed with one of the following SKUs:
- UltraPerformance
- ErGw3AZ
- ERGwScale with a minimum of 20 scale units

![2]

## <a name="VNetGateway"></a>Create an ExpressRoute Connection
The ExpressRoute connection establishes a link between the  ExpressRoute Gateway and the ExpressRoute circuit. The FastPath feature can be enabled in the ExpressRoute Connection by the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId <Subscription id here>

$connection = Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name '_ER_CONNECTION_NAME_' -ResourceGroupName '_RG_NAME_'
$connection.ExpressRouteGatewayBypass = $true
Set-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection  -VirtualNetworkGatewayConnection $connection
```
After enabling FastPath, the value of **$connection.ExpressRouteGatewayBypass** should have the value **$true**.

In the Azure management portal, navigate to the Connections blade of your ExpressRoute circuit. Under Settings-Configuration, verified the FastPath setting to Enable

![3]

The ExpressRoute connection requires the activation of the attribute **EnablePrivateLinkFastPath**
```powershell
$connection.EnablePrivateLinkFastPath = $true
Set-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -VirtualNetworkGatewayConnection $connection
```

At this stage of deployment, the Azure VNet is connected to the on-premises networks, and ExpressRoute is properly configured to support High Bandwidth tunnels.

## <a name="on-premises network"></a>Advertisement of the on-premises network to the ExpressRoute circuit
IPsec tunnels are established via transit through ExpressRoute private peering. To enable these tunnels, the private IP addresses of the on-premises VPN devices must be advertised from the customerâ€™s edge routers to the Microsoft Enterprise Edge (MSEE) routers. If other on-prem networks are advertised to ExpressRoute, this runs the risk of "leaking" these routes to the VNet, which could bypass the VPN Gateway and traffic could go directly to the ExpressRoute gateway, bypassing encryption. So it's important to only advertise the VPN Device tunnel IPs over ExpressRoute.

The routes between the VPN Device and the VPN Gateway should contain the detailed on-prem networks, routing can be via static routes or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). By keeping your on-prem networks in this routing "channel" you'll ensure Azure traffic to on-prem is encrypted before entering the ExpressRoute data path, traveling inside the VPN tunnel.

If you do add routes to ExpressRoute that you wish to encrypt, a UDR will be needed on the VNets pointing to the VPN Gateway as the next hop to ensure that traffic is put into the encrypted tunnel before transiting ExpressRoute.

## <a name="VNetGateway"></a>Create a VPN gateway High Bandwidth tunnel
In this step, you create a virtual network gateway (VPN gateway) High Bandwidth tunnels for your virtual network. The High Bandwidth tunnel is supported only on VpnGw5AZ SKU.

In the Azure portal:
1. Search for "Virtual network gateway" in the top search bar.
1. Select Create and configure the VPN gateway using the specified values for High Bandwidth setup.

* **Name**: vpnHB
* **Gateway type**: VPN
* **SKU**: VpnGw5AZ
* **Generation**: Generation 2
* **Enable Advanced Connectivity**: Enabled 
* **Virtual network**: VNet1
* **Gateway subnet address range**: 10.1.0.0/26
* **Public IP address**: Create new
* **Public IP address name:** vpnHBT-pip1
* **Public IP address SKU:** Standard
* **Assignment:** Static
* **Second Public IP address**: Create new
* **Second Public IP address name:** vpnHBT-pip2
* **Public IP address SKU:** Standard
* **Assignment:** Static
* **Configure BGP**: Disabled

![5]

> [!NOTE]
> To select the High Bandwidth VPN Gateway in the Azure portal, enable the **Enable Advanced Connectivity** property during gateway creation. When this option is selected, Azure automatically configures the gateway in active-active mode.
>  High Bandwidth tunnels can be deployed with static routing or BGP. The High Bandwidth tunnels are supported only in VPN Gateway route-based gateways.

A gateway can take 45 minutes or more to fully create and deploy. You can see the deployment status on the **Overview** page for your gateway.

In a High Bandwidth VPN Gateway setup, traffic is routed through the private IP addresses of the VPN Gateway instance. Although two public IP addresses are still assigned during deployment, their exclusive function is to facilitate communication with the Azure control plane. These public IPs aren't involved in establishing IPsec tunnels.

## <a name="LocalNetworkGateway"></a>Create a local network gateway

The local network gateway is an Azure resource that represents your on-premises site for routing purposes. You assign it a name for Azure to reference, specify the IP address of your on-premises VPN device, and define the IP address prefixes that should be routed through the VPN gateway to that device. These prefixes correspond to your on-premises network.

If your VPN device has two IP addresses you want to connect to, you must create a separate local network gateway for each one.
You can create the Local Network Gateways only when you know the IP addresses assigned to the outbound interfaces of the on-premises VPN device.

![6]

Create two local network gateways by using the following values:

* **Name**: vpnLocalNetGw1
* **Location**: West US 2
* **IP Address**: 192.168.1.1
* **Address Space(s)**: 10.10.0.0/16
* **Configure BGP settings**: NO

* **Name**: vpnLocalNetGw2
* **Location**: West US 2
* **IP Address**: 192.168.1.5
* **Address Space(s)**: 10.10.0.0/16
* **Configure BGP settings**: NO

![7]

![8]

After the deployment of the two Local Network Gateways you're ready to proceed with VPN Connections.

## <a name="CreateConnection"></a>Create VPN Connections
The VPN High Bandwidth Gateway supports a maximum of two VPN Connections. 
A single VPN Connection can establish two tunnels with your on-premises VPN device.
Create two Connections by using the following values:

* **Connection type**: Site-to-site
* **Name**: vpnConn1
* **Virtual network gateway**: vpnHB
* **Local network gateway name**: vpnConn1
* **Shared key**: For this example, **abc123** is used as an example. But you can use whatever is compatible with your VPN hardware. The important thing is that the values match on both sides of the connection.

* **Connection type**: Site-to-site
* **Name**: vpnConn2
* **Virtual network gateway**: vpnHB
* **Local network gateway name**: vpnConn2
* **Shared Key (PSK)**: **abc123**.

> [!NOTE]
> Only after the deployment of two VPN Connections, through the Azure portal you can discover the private IP addresses assigned to the VPN Gateway instances.

In Azure portal select the Azure VPN Gateway and then **Settings** and **Connections**

![15]

The Connection view displays the tunnel IP addresses associated with the VPN Gateway instance and their corresponding peersâ€”represented by Local Network Gateways. In our High Bandwidth VPN Gateway setup, the tunnel IPs are mapped as follows:

* tunnel IP: 10.1.6 peered with Local Network Gateway vpnLocalGw1
* tunnel IP: 10.1.8 peered with Local Network Gateway vpnLocalGw1
* tunnel IP: 10.1.7 peered with Local Network Gateway vpnLocalGw2
* tunnel IP: 10.1.9 peered with Local Network Gateway vpnLocalGw2

This mapping reflects how each tunnel IP is paired with a specific local network gateway to establish site-to-site VPN connections.

## <a name="VPNDevice"></a>Configure your VPN device on-premises
Configuring the on-premises VPN device is the final step. The information gathered up to this point is sufficient to complete the device configuration.  

![16]

When you configure your VPN device, you need the following values:

* **Shared key**: This shared key is the same one that you specify when you create your site-to-site VPN connection. In our examples, we use a simple shared key. We recommend that you generate a more complex key to use.
* **private IP addresses of tunnels in VPN Gateway**: each VPN gateway instance has two tunnel IPs. The High Bandwidth tunnels expect to have four IPsec tunnels. In some VPN devices, the configuration can be implemented through Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTIs). Each private IP address on the outbound interface of the on-premises VPN device can be associated with up to two virtual tunnel interfaces.

* **IP address space assigned to the Azure VNet**

![17]

The pseudo configuration of VPN device on-premises looks like:

```console
interface 1
  ip address 192.168.1.1/32

interface 2
  ip address 192.168.1.5/32

interface tunnel  0
  ip address 192.168.10.1/32
  tunnel source 192.168.1.1
  tunnel destination 10.1.1.6

interface tunnel 1
  ip address 192.168.10.2/32
  source address 192.168.1.1
  destination address 10.1.1.8

interface tunnel 2
  ip address 192.168.10.5/32
  source address 192.168.1.5
  destination address 10.1.1.7

interface tunnel 3
  ip address 192.168.10.6/32
  source address 192.168.1.5
  destination address 10.1.1.9

static routing:
    10.1.0.0/24 next-hop: tunnel 0
    10.1.0.0/24 next-hop: tunnel 1
    10.1.0.0/24 next-hop: tunnel 2
    10.1.0.0/24 next-hop: tunnel 3
```

### <a name="configure-connect"></a>Configure custom encryption algorithms (optional)

In each VPN Connection you can define a custom IKEv2 and IPsec policy to match the encryption requirements. For more information, see [Configure custom IPsec/IKE connection policies](ipsec-ike-policy-howto.md).
