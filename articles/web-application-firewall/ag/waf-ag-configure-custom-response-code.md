# Configure custom response code and body for Azure Application Gateway WAF


By default, when Web Application Firewall (WAF) on Application Gateway blocks a request due to a matched rule, it returns a 403 status code with the message "The request is blocked." You can customize the response by configuring a custom status code and message to better suit your use case.

This article shows you how to configure a custom response page when Azure Application Gateway's Web Application Firewall (WAF) blocks a request using the Azure portal. You can also configure custom responses using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/network/application-gateway/waf-policy/policy-setting) and PowerShell. 

## Configure a custom response status code and message

To customize the response status code and body, take the following steps:

1. Go to your Application Gateway WAF policy in the Azure portal.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Policy settings**.

1. Enter the custom response status code and response body in **Block response status code** and **Block response body** respectively.

1. Select **Save**.

In this example, we changed the default 403 response code to 429 and set a brief message stating, "The request has been blocked".
