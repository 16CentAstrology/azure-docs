> [!NOTE]
> * When counting the number of APIs and API-related resource (such as API operations, backends, tags, and so on), API Management also includes API versions and revisions.
> 
> *  If your service approaches a limit, remove unused resources (such as unused API versions or revisions) to free up capacity.
> 
> * If a limit is reached, consider [upgrading](../articles/api-management/upgrade-and-scale.md) to a higher service tier.
>
> * To request a limit increase, create a support request from the Azure portal. For more information, see [Azure support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/). Increasing a limit might affect service capacity or cause increased latency in some service operations.
