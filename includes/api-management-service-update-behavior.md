> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changes to the API Management service infrastructure (such as configuring custom domains, adding CA certificates, scaling, virtual network configuration, availability zone changes, and region additions) can take 15 minutes or longer to complete, depending on the service tier and the size of the deployment. Expect longer times for an instance with a greater number of scale units or multi-region configuration. While these changes are in progress, other service infrastructure changes can't be made.
>
> Instances in all service tiers except the Developer tier do not experience gateway downtime while changes are in progress. During this time you may also update settings for API, product, policy, and user management.
