Available in v4.0.0.0 and later, the Azure VPN Client system tray allows you to close the Azure VPN Client application while keeping the connection active. When you close the application, you can see the application in the Windows system tray. You can reopen the Azure VPN Client app in compact mode by clicking the tray icon.
